:::caution Alpha Feature

This is currently an alpha feature. The API could potentially undergo
significant changes in the future.

:::

## Prerequisites

To use Contentful Preview, ensure you have followed the
[`Magic Button`](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/2.x/category/magic-button)
documentation to setup `Contribution Mode`.

You need to add a `FRONT_COMMERCE_CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment
variable to your `.env` file. This token will be used to authenticate the
preview requests.

## How to Configure Contentful space

To take advantage of Contentful's Preview Mode, you need to set up URL
configurations for the
[preview environment](https://www.contentful.com/help/setup-content-preview#preview-content-in-your-online-environment)
in your Contentful space.

Follow these steps to configure your Contentful settings:

1. Navigate to `Settings` > `Content Preview` in your Contentful space.
2. Click the `Add content preview` button.

You'll need to provide the following information:

- `Name`: Enter the name for this particular content type preview.
- `Description`: Provide a brief description of this content type preview.
- `Content preview URLs`: Enter a list of URLs that you'd like to use to preview
  different content types.

In Front-Commerce, we provide a specific endpoint,
`/contentful/preview/:space/:contentType/:id`, that you can use as a
`Content preview URL`.

Here is a sample format to follow when configuring the URL:

```
https://acme.app/contentful/preview/{env_id}/{entry.sys.contentType.sys.id}/{entry.sys.id}?secret=YOUR_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Where:

- `env_id` corresponds to the environment of the current entry.
- `entry.sys.contentType.sys.id` will resolve to the content type id of the
  current entry.
- `entry.sys.id` will resolve to the entry id.

:::tip

Due to technical limitations in Contentful, to preview a local environment, you
must either use `ngrok` to expose your local server to the internet and benefit
from the Live Preview feature (iframe), or open the preview in another window.
Replace `acme.app` in the sample URL above with your ngrok or localhost URL
accordingly.

## Configuring Your Application

By default, the preview route will direct you to the landing page (`/`) of your
application. However, you can customize this behavior by registering an _URL
matcher_.

The `registerUrlMatcher` method is accessible through the Contentful loader's
`routes` object, it accepts two parameters:

- `contentType`: The contentful GraphQL type name of the entry you want to
  match.
- `urlFormatter`: A function that receives the entry id and the entry metadata
  as arguments. This function should return a string or null.

The `urlFormatter` function determines the URL to which the preview route will
redirect:

- If `urlFormatter` returns a string, the preview route will redirect to the URL
  defined by that string.
- If `urlFormatter` returns null, the preview route will default to the landing
  page.

Here's an example of how you might register a `urlMatcher`:

```js
export default {
    [..],
    contextEnhancer: ({loaders}) => {
        loaders.Contentful.routes.registerUrlMatcher("Page", (id, metadata) => {
            if (id === "dntmgP2QV6uRuRChrdLFj") {
                return `/contact-us`;
            }
            return null;
        });

        loaders.Contentful.routes.registerUrlMatcher("BlogPost", async (id) => {
            const blogpost = await loaders.ContentfulClient.getEntry(id);
            if (!blogpost.fields.slug) {
                return null;
            }
            return `/blog/${blogpost.fields.slug}`;
        });
    }
}
```

This allows you to control the behavior of your application's preview mode on a
per-content-type basis, enhancing flexibility and customization.
