description:
  Front-Commerceâ€™s GraphQL modules can register GraphQL schema extensions and
  resolvers to actually fetch the data. This page contains the different keys
  available in the GraphQL context object managed by Front-Commerce.

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

Front-Commerce manages a **context object** and makes it available in the
GraphQL schema so resolvers can use it
[using standard GraphQL mechanisms](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers).

:::info

To get started with GraphQL modules, we recommend you to read the
[Extend the GraphQL schema](/docs/2.x/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema)
documentation page.

:::

## `loaders`

The `loaders` key contains all the loaders registered by GraphQL modules, from
their
[`contextEnhancer` module definition method](/docs/2.x/reference/graphql-module-definition#contextenhancer-optional).

Example :

```js title="my-module/server/modules/clicks-counters/resolvers.js"
export default {
  Product: {
    clicksCounter: ({ sku }, _, context) => {
      return context.loaders.Counter.loadBySku(sku);
    },
  },
};
```

See
[Slim down resolvers with loaders](/docs/2.x/advanced/graphql/slim-down-resolvers-with-loaders)
to understand how to leverage this value.

## `req`

The `req` key contains the current HTTP request (from
[Express server](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req)) having triggered the
GraphQL query.

It could be useful in some specific cases, but we generally recommend **NOT TO**
use it directly. Resolvers should to use [`loaders`](#loaders) instead.

One of the reason why it has been introduced in the core, is to allow context
customization in Remote schema stitching scenario. See
[`linkContextBuilders` for an usage example](/docs/2.x/reference/graphql-module-definition#linkcontextbuilders-optional).
