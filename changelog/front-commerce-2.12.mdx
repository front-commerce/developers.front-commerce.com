allowing you to save items in a way that is far more efficient than with
wishlists, and you can now manage your teams and users using a nice drag and
drop tool!

We‚Äôve stepped up our cloud game with our brand new partner Akamai!

You‚Äôll also discover the password strength display feature, to enhance the
password experience of your user, as well as new components available for the
Page Builder for Front-Commerce.

We have also included various changes and bug corrections, to always improve
**your Front-Commerce experience!**

The beginning of 2022 will come with a lot of new things at Front-Commerce:

## B2B for Adobe Commerce: allow your clients to manage their company from Front-Commerce

### Requisition lists

By using requisition lists, customers can save time when ordering products that
are frequently required, as the items can be added to the shopping cart directly
from the list. Users can handle multiple lists that focus on products from
various suppliers, buyers, teams ...

The requisition list feature is similar to wish lists but they can be used
multiple times and the user interface is more adapted to a large number of items

### Company Structure

With the company structure page, account management remains easy for big company
administrators: starting from the Company Administrator, the tree structure can
be expanded to include teams of users. The users can be associated with teams or
organised within a hierarchy of divisions and subdivisions within the company!

### Quick add to cart

To help B2B users purchase items more efficiently, we have imagined a Quick Add
To Cart Component that can be added pretty much anywhere on a website, allowing
to search items by SKU and product name and quickly add them to the cart, rather
than browsing the categories pages (especially when you already know what you
want!)

The component leverages Front-Commerce search modules to offer the same search
experience as the main search bar.

## UI new feature: Password Strength display

We‚Äôve improved password inputs in several screens of our default themes.
Password inputs now allow a user to view the entered password, and its strength
is hinted as the user types. This new component works as an indicator to display
the strength of the password used by the customer during registration. It helps
the user know if the password is strong enough, as well as the level of
difficulty to crack it in case of a security breach.

## Page Builder upgraded

In Front-Commerce 2.11 version, we released a first basic version of the
[Adobe Page Builder for Front-Commerce](/docs/magento2/page-builder): our
strategy runs its course with first improvements!

You now can use the following components end content types, from the Page
Builder and rendered in Front-Commerce:

- HTML content type
- Slider
- Image
- Row Background images and styles
- Map content type

We have also improved the way existing content types work, adding some new
parameters from the Page Builder (as a reminder, text, heading, divider and row
were already handled)

Your feedback is precious, do not hesitate to contact us to share your needs and
identified axis of improvement
