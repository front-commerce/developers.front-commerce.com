title: Change a resolver behavior
description:
  In a project, it is quite usual to have the need to change the implementation
  of the resolver associated with a GraphQL field. This page explains how to do
  it properly so that the project remains as maintainable as possible.
---

As an example, we will change the way the Product `meta_description` field value
is generated.

## Create dedicated GraphQL module

First, you have to create a GraphQL module. For that, you can follow the process
detailed in the
[Create a new GraphQL module](/docs/2.x/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema#create-a-new-graphql-module).
Don't forget to also to
[register the module in Front-Commerce](/docs/2.x/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema#register-the-module-in-the-application).

For this example, the `ProductMetaDescription` module containing:

```js title="src/server/modules/productmetadescription/index.js"
export default {
  namespace: "ProductMetaDescription",
};
```

## Set the module dependency

Before being able to inject you custom resolver logic, you first need to find
the module that defines the resolver for the field. In our example, the Product
`meta_description` is resolved
[by the resolver provided by the `Magento2/Catalog/Products` module](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/784684ce56cca69ca5c2e42d5d421a8c0b4bb9c3/src/server/modules/magento2/catalog/products/resolvers.js#L267-270).
As a result, the `Magento2/Catalog/Products` module must be added as a
dependency of our custom module:

```js title="src/server/modules/productmetadescription/index.js"
export default {
  namespace: "ProductMetaDescription",
  // highlight-next-line
  dependencies: ["Magento2/Catalog/Products"],
};
```

## Implement your custom resolver logic

Our custom module can now provide a resolver with a custom logic.

```js title="src/server/modules/productmetadescription/index.js"
// highlight-start
import resolvers from "./resolvers";

// highlight-end
export default {
  namespace: "ChangeResolverBehavior",
  dependencies: ["Magento2/Catalog/Products"],
  // highlight-next-line
  resolvers,
};
```

And the resolver could look like:

```js title="src/server/modules/productmetadescription/resolvers.js"
export default {
  Product: {
    meta_description: (product) => {
      // your implementation here
      return "my custom description";
    },
  },
};
```

This custom resolver will now be merged with the existing ones and the
`meta_description` will be resolved with our custom implementation instead of
the default one.
