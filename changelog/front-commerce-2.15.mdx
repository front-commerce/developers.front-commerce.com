## Prismic: embed fields

Our first version of the Prismic x Front-Commerce connector has been around
since
[our version 2.7](https://developers.front-commerce.com/blog/2021/06/15/front-commerce-2.7/),
almost a year ago!

Since then, the connector has evolved significantly, with the progressive
release of new fields, performance improvements and the awaited
[Preview feature (available from F-C 2.13)](https://developers.front-commerce.com/blog/2022/02/17/front-commerce-2.13/)

For this release 2.15, we worked on the embed fields! With it, you‚Äôll be able to
embed content from numerous providers in no time! An overview of our whole
Prismic connector will come soon, stay tuned!

## Magento: notify your customers with back-in-stock alerts (M1 and M2)

Magento (1 and 2) offers a variety of alerts, allowing to keep your customers
posted depending on changes to your prices or stock.

Thus, the
_[in-stock alerts](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/inventory-product-alerts.html#in-stock-alerts)_
feature creates _Notify me when this product is in stock_ link for every product
that is out of stock. We transformed the existing features to improve the
customer experience: customers can click the link to subscribe to the alert from
the product page and they can also directly unsubscribe from the exact same
page. When the product is back in stock, customers receive an email notification
that the product is available.

## BigCommerce: place your first order on [Big x Front]Commerce

It‚Äôs almost there! We have made great progress on our BigCommerce connector and
the demo will be available soon, joining
[our existing ones](https://demo.front-commerce.app/)!

Stay tuned for the unveiling video demo which will come up in the coming weeks
üôÇ

As a teaser, here is the list of things we will be able to demonstrate shortly
with a [Big x Front]Commerce connector :

- Navigation as a guest, product lists and paginated categories with filters
- Product page for both simple and configurable products (variants)
- BigCommerce native checkout redirection
- Guest checkout

With this perimeter, we will provide a MVP allowing you to experience the power
of Front-Commerce and BigCommerce together!

## Magento2: use the native search capabilities of Magento for PLP

As part of Front-Commerce, we already offer you the search capabilities from the
ElasticSuite and Algolia. The search-related features on Magento2 have
progressed a lot during the past months: therefore, we decided to make Magento2
native search available for Front-Commerce, starting with PLP!

## For developers: **npm 7 / NodeJS 16 / NodeJS 17 compatibility**

Starting from 2.15.0, we dropped support for Node 12, and ensured compatibility
**with Node 14, 16, and 17.** Our Node support strategy from this point on, will
be to support:

- The previous LTS version. (14 at the time of 2.15.0)
- The active LTS version. (16 at the time of 2.15.0)
- The current Node version, on a best effort basis. (17 is supported at the time
  of 2.15.0)

Our support for NodeJS versions follows the
[NodeJS release calendar](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) with a delay of
one release cycle (6 weeks at the time of writing). We believe this strategy is
balanced between backwards compatibility and encouragement to use of latest
NodeJS versions to avoid security pitfalls - all the while being anchored on a
the stable and sensible release calendar from NodeJS.

NB: If you plan to use **NodeJS 17 or npm 7+** in your environment, there might
be some changes that you need to implement. Please refer to our
[migration guides for the details](/docs/2.x/appendices/migration-guides#2140---2150).

## Adyen: integrate Paypal w. Adyen for a seamless checkout experience

You‚Äôll be able to process payments using Paypal through for Front-Commerce :
this will allow you to considerably improve the user experience during checkout
for customers using Paypal.

## Twicpics connector: early version

As mentioned on [their website](https://www.twicpics.com/), TwicPics deliver
perfectly sized images and videos, in real-time, on your websites and on your
apps to help you optimize your users' experience.

As a vivid actor of [the MACH ecosystem](https://machalliance.org/), we could
not agree more! Thanks to our connector, TwicPics for Front-Commerce, you will
be able to integrate the powerful capabilities and APIs of TwicPics very easily
to deliver media on your e-commerce website.
