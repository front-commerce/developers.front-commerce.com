  With Front-Commerce comes a CLI tool ("front-commerce") that helps you launch
  the tasks needed to develop, build and launch your application. This reference
  documentation explains how to use it in a project.
---

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

These commands should be launched from your project's root directory. This can
be done by:

- Using npm scripts (just like
  [front-commerce-skeleton/package.json](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce-skeleton/blob/main/package.json#L7))
- Prefixing the commands with `npx` which will call the `front-commerce` bin in
  your project

## `front-commerce help`

Displays a message referencing the different commands available.

## `front-commerce lint`

This command ensures that your project is correctly linted. This means that it
will:

- format your code with prettier
- prevent errors by using eslint rules

In order to configure the rules, please refer to the `eslintConfig` key in your
`package.json`.

A basic config could be :

```json
{
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "react-app"],
  "plugins": ["prettier", "security"],
  "rules": {
    "no-console": [
      "warn",
      {
        "allow": ["warn", "error"]
      }
    ],
    "prettier/prettier": "warn"
  }
}
```

The files linted are the files within the modules you have defined in
[`.front-commerce.js`](/docs/2.x/reference/front-commerce-js). However, the
modules that are in `node_modules` won't be linted.

:::note

Please note that the errors and warnings that this tool will log are also
displayed when using `front-commerce start` in development mode. The
`front-commerce lint` command is mainly useful when you want to ensure that your
code is correctly linted before committing it to your repository.

## `front-commerce prepare`

This command will generate all the files needed to launch a Front-Commerce
application. It will use the
[`.front-commerce.js`](/docs/2.x/reference/front-commerce-js) configuration file
to know what to generate.

The generated files will be located in the `.front-commerce` folder in the root
of your project.

## `front-commerce build`

Before running this command, please make sure to run `front-commerce prepare`.

This command will generate all the compiled files needed to launch your
application in a production environment. The generated files will be located in
the `build` folder in the root of your project.

Once it is generated, you can launch the application by using
`NODE_ENV=production front-commerce start`.

## `front-commerce start`

This command will launch the Front-Commerce application. There are two modes
available:

- `NODE_ENV=development front-commerce start`: launches Front-Commerce
  application in development mode (hot reloading, linting, etc.). Please make
  sure to have launched `front-commerce prepare` beforehand.
- `NODE_ENV=production front-commerce start`: launches Front-Commerce
  application in production mode (using precompiled code). Please make sure to
  have launched `front-commerce build` beforehand.

## `front-commerce styleguide`

This command lets you view your Front-Commerce's components in
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

There are two modes available:

- `NODE_ENV=development front-commerce styleguide`: launches Storybook in
  development mode (hot reloading, linting, etc.).
- `NODE_ENV=production front-commerce styleguide`: builds the assets of
  Storybook in `build/styleguide`. The generated files could then be served on
  any hosting solution supporting static websites.

## `front-commerce translate`

This command checks your translations and adds the missing one to
`translations/[lang].json` in the root of your application. See
[Translate what's in your components](/docs/2.x/advanced/theme/translations#translate-whats-in-your-components)
for more information.

If some translations are missing, the script will throw an error. This lets you
ensure that everything is correctly translated in your CI.

### Options

- `--ignore-build`: By default, this command will build your application to make
  sure that no translation is forgotten. However, if you've just run
  `front-commerce build`, this step is not necessary. `--ignore-build` option is
  what makes it possible not to build the application during the translation.
- `--module` (`-m`): scope translations to a specific module registered in your
  `.front-commerce.js` configuration file. Translation files will be written in
  the `/path/to/module/translations` directory instead of your application's
  one.

## `front-commerce test`

This command allows to launch tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) already
configured to work properly with a Front-Commerce codebase.

By default this command will launch all the tests available. These tests can be
categorized in three scopes (which are jest projects internally):

- `server`: it runs all the unit tests in `server/**/__tests__` folders.
- `pact`: it runs all the [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/) tests in
  `server/**/__pacts__` folders. Its specificity is that it boots a pact server
  that will allow you to mock interactions with external APIs. Its main usage is
  for testing loaders in GraphQL modules.
- `client`: it runs all the tests in `web/**/__tests__` folders. Its specificity
  is that it boots under a jsdom environment allowing you to use a mocked DOM
  environment. It is necessary to use when testing React components.

You can only parts of the tests by setting the scope when executing the command:
`front-commerce test <scope>`. If no scope is defined all the scopes will be
executed.

After the scope, you can use any Jest option. For instance if you want to run
the tests in watch mode, you should add `--watch` at the end of your command.

:::tip ProTipâ„¢

If you are abstracting the `front-commerce` CLI with
[npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), please note that you can
pass any option(s) to your npm script by using this syntax:
`npm run test -- <option1> <option2>`.

## `front-commerce codemod`

Codemods generally help with breaking changes, and code clean up. They are also
used to migrate your codebase to the latest version of Front-Commerce.

| Options                | Description                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `help, -h, --help`     | Outputs all the available options.                |
| `-l, --list`           | List all the available codemods                   |
| `-t, --type [codemod]` | The type of codemod you would like to run         |
| `-d, --dry`            | Do a dry run, this will not save the changes      |
| `-Y, --yes`            | Automatically answer yes to all questions         |
| `-f, --force`          | Force the codemod to run                          |
| `-V, --verbose`        | Show more information about the transform process |
