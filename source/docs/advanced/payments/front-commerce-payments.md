Front-Commerce contains mechanisms that allow to process payments in a platform-agnostic way. Payment interactions occur from Front-Commerce GraphQL/Node.js middleware so that remote systems (<abbr title="Order Management System">OMS</abbr>, <abbr title="Enterprise resource planning">ERP</abbr> softwares …) will only receive Orders when they are paid.

Payment platforms integrated as a Front-Commerce Payment are compatible with every eCommerce platform that Front-Commerce supports. They also are aimed at being as frictionless as possible for Customers, so payment inputs are usually embedded in the checkout page to prevent redirecting Customers to third-party providers. Per their nature follow the [Direct Order payment workflow](/docs/advanced/payments/payment-workflows.html#Direct-Order).

## How is a Front-Commerce Payment method integrated with eCommerce platforms

Front-Commerce handle payments directly, without the need for a payment integration in your eCommerce system. However, **Front-Commerce provides a generic Payment method** tailored for your eCommerce platform so that you can still benefit from its order management features and workflows.

From your eCommerce system's perspective, a payment made with Front-Commerce is integrated in a similar way than checks / wire payments (sometimes named "offline payment"). The difference is that Front-Commerce will update orders statuses upon receiving automatic notifications from the payment service.

## Implement a new Front-Commerce Payment method

<blockquote class="wip">
**Work In Progress** This section is not as detailed as we would love it to be. Please let us know if you need further information before we improve it.

Front-Commerce allows you to implement your own payment method. New embedded payment methods have to be registered from a GraphQL module. Let’s create a new "PWAy" payment module for a fictive payment provider.

1. [create a new GraphQL module](/docs/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema.html#Create-a-new-GraphQL-module)
2. add a depency upon `"Magento2/Checkout"`

```js
export default {
  namespace: "Payments/PWAy",
  dependencies: ["Magento2/Checkout"],
};
```

3. register the payment method from the module’s [`contextEnhancer`](/docs/reference/graphql-module-definition.html#contextEnhancer-optional)

```js
export default {
  namespace: "Payments/PWAy",
  dependencies: ["Magento2/Checkout"],
  contextEnhancer: ({ loaders }) => {
    // [...] initialization here

    const chargeTransactionForOrder = (paymentData, orderId) => {
      /* … the actual code that will charge the transaction (might delegate to a loader) … */
    };

    const METHOD_CODE = "pway_awesomecheckout";
    const METHOD_TITLE = "PWAy";
    loaders.Payment.registerEmbeddedPaymentMethod(
      METHOD_CODE,
      METHOD_TITLE,
      chargeTransactionForOrder
    );

    return {}; // you may export loaders here in case the payment provides custom Queries (to fetch a payment token for instance)
  },
};
```

<blockquote class="note">
We encourage you to investigate `payment-` modules' source code from [Front-Commerce's core](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/main/src/server/modules) to learn about advanced patterns.
