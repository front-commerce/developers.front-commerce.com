There are many ways to integrate payments in Front-Commerce. We support different payment workflows, payment modules from different platforms (Magento2 â€¦) and Front-Commerce can also process payments itself with Front-Commerce payment modules.

In this section, you will learn how payments can be added to an application. It contains **installation guides** for supported payment method for each platform along with **implementation guides** so that one can implement new methods.
