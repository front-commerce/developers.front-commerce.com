## Closing 2022 with BigCommerce multi-store support, Cloudinary, Node 18 and pro-active monitoring for Cloud customers

As the year comes to a close, we're excited to announce important updates for
BigCommerce projects and Front-Commerce Cloud customers.

In this release, we've focused on polishing the product and fixing bugs, as part
of our quarterly _cleaning session_. This ensures that Front-Commerce continues
to provide a stable and reliable platform for building online stores.

Additionally, with several projects going live over the past few weeks, our team
has been busy providing support and expertise to help make these projects a
success. Congratulations to everyone involved in these production releases -
we're proud to see more Front-Commerce storefronts out there!

## BigCommerce accounts and multi-store

In this release, we've added support for key features in the BigCommerce
platform, including:

- Multi-store with channel support, including cart creation, prices, and a
  forgot password functionality
- User account management, including address management, order pages with
  shipment information, and wishlist management
- Product swatches

These additions bring our BigCommerce connector up to par with the platform's
most important features.

## Cloudinary image adapter

We're introducing support for [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) as another
best-of-breed solution for image management in Front-Commerce.

For those unfamiliar, Cloudinary is a cloud-based platform that offers a range
of image-related services, including storage, optimization, and manipulation.
With the Cloudinary adapter, you can now use these services seamlessly within
your Front-Commerce projects, **without the need for any additional
customization in your existing theme** (if you're using the `<Image>`
component).

This new integration allows you to take advantage of Cloudinary's powerful
image-related capabilities, helping you to improve the performance and visual
appeal of your online store.
[Read our guide explaining how to enable Cloudinary in your project.](/docs/2.x/advanced/images-adapters/cloudinary)

## Node 18 compatibility

In this release, we've made sure that Front-Commerce is fully compatible with
Node 18. This ensures that you can use the latest version of Node.js when
building your Front-Commerce projects.

It's worth nothing that Front-Commerce supports
[all actively supported Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Node.js](https://endoflife.date/nodejs).
This means that you can use the latest LTS release of Node.js with
Front-Commerce, and be confident that you will never be blocked on an outdated
node version.

**We recommend that you take this opportunity to upgrade to Node 18 and test
your Front-Commerce application as part of the update to 2.20.** This may be as
simple as updating your Dockerfiles and CI pipelines to use the latest version
of Node.js. By doing so, you can take advantage of the latest improvements and
security updates in Node.js, while still being able to rely on long-term support
for your application.

## Front-Commerce Cloud improvements

In this release, we've made a number of improvements to Front-Commerce Cloud,
our managed hosting platform for Front-Commerce projects.

- We've added support for **redirection plans with thousands of lines**. This
  allows you to define complex redirect rules for your application, making it
  easier to manage your website's URLs and improve its SEO during large content
  reorganization.
- We've implemented a new mechanism to prevent concurrent builds on the same
  branch. This ensures that your builds are not interrupted or corrupted by
  other builds running at the same time, resulting in more stable and reliable
  deployments.
- We've introduced the ability to specify the Node.js version to use for each
  branch in your repository. This allows you to **use different versions of
  Node.js for different branches**.

_These features are not yet available in self-service, but <ContactLink>our
support team</ContactLink> will be able to apply these changes to your project
within a few hours!_

## Pro-active monitoring for Cloud projects

We're excited to announce the launch of pro-active monitoring for Front-Commerce
Cloud projects. This new service is designed to **help teams continuously
improve the quality of their projects and provide the best possible experience
for their customers**.

Over the coming weeks, we'll be reaching out to development teams of
Front-Commerce Cloud projects on a regular basis to highlight the most important
issues detected on their projects. This pro-active approach will help teams
**quickly identify and resolve root causes of problems, saving time on bug
detection and resolution**.

This is an ongoing process. New devices, content changes, new versions of your
code or remote services updates are all contributing to an uncertain world! With
pro-active monitoring, we hope to support a culture of continuous improvement,
so that teams can quickly and easily resolve any issues that may arise and
embrace uncertainty.

We're looking forward to receiving feedback on this new feature, and we'll be
working to **shape the pro-active monitoring process to fit seamlessly into your
workflow**. If you have any thoughts or suggestions, <ContactLink>please let us
know!</ContactLink>

## Supporting projects and teams

As the end of the year approaches, we're pleased to see several Front-Commerce
projects that were started earlier this year reaching completion. These projects
range from **progressive migrations and new storefronts, to full frontend
reworks, showcasing the diverse range of applications for Front-Commerce.**

In addition to developing new features for Front-Commerce, our core team is also
dedicated to providing support and high-quality service to our partners and
customers. This ensures that their projects are successful and meet their goals.

We've been working closely with project teams on a variety of topics to ensure
the success of their Front-Commerce projects. This includes audits, performance
improvements, expertise, support for last-minute bugs, platform monitoring, and
stabilization.

**Congratulation to partners and customers** for reaching these milestones with
us! ðŸŽ‰
