## Front-Commerce web application manifest generation

Front-Commerce implements the following mechanism to generate [a web app
manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) so that the web
browser can detect that it's a Progressive Web Application (PWA):


1. Pages generated by Front-Commerce include the following markup:
  ```html
  <link rel="manifest" href="http://your.website.example.com/manifest.json" />
  ```
  so that the browser knows where to find this web app manifest.
1. The `manifest.json` is dynamically generated by Front-Commerce based on
   `public/manifest.json` available on the disk and on the project
   environment (URLs, â€¦).


## Customizations

### `manifest.json`

To customize the `manifest.json` generated by Front-Commerce, you have to copy
the `public/manifest.json` from Front-Commerce to your project:

```bash
# from the root of project, usually a clone of the skeleton
mkdir src/public
cp node_modules/front-commerce/public/manifest.json src/public/manifest.json
```

Then you can customize `src/public/manifest.json` content to match your project.
Commonly, you will change the `name`, `short_name`, the colors and the icons.

:::info

* Icons URL are automatically rewritten so that it matches the environment in
  which you use them. So as the default file you must use relative paths.
* The scope is automatically generated based on the URL of your store(s).
* Don't change the `start_url`, see below if you want to customize
  `app-shell.html` content.

:::

### `app-shell.html`

`app-shell.html` is generated at build time based on a template file;
`theme-chocolatine/template/app-shell.html` or `src/template/app-shell.html`
depending on the theme being used on your project. If you want to customize the
resulting `app-shell.html` on your project, you can copy one of this template to
your project:

```bash
# from the root of project, usually a clone of the skeleton
mkdir src/template
cp node_modules/front-commerce/theme-chocolatine/template/app-shell.html src/template/app-shell.html
```

And you can apply any change on your own copy of the template to match your
requirements.
