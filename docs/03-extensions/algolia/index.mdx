indices to list and search for products, categories or pages."

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

## Prerequisites

To use this extension, you need an Algolia account to access the dashboard.
You'll also need to create an application and to get access the corresponding
API keys.

Depending on how the extension is configured (it's _flavor_), you might also
need to install the Algolia Magento module matching your Magento version.

## Installation

First, you need to install the `@front-commerce/algolia` package:

```bash title="Command to install @front-commerce/algolia"
$ pnpm install @front-commerce/algolia
```

Then to enable the extension, you need to add the Algolia extension definition
to your `front-commerce.config.ts`. When doing that, you need to pass the
_flavor_ in which you want to run the extension, the _flavor_ must be one of the
following values:

- `magento2`: in this _flavor_, the extension is configured to work with indices
  created by the Magento2 Algolia module. See
  [the corresponding How-to](/docs/3.x/extensions/algolia/how-to/magento2) for
  more details.
- `magento1`: in this _flavor_, the extension is configured to work with indices
  created by the Magento1 Algolia module. See
  [the corresponding How-to](/docs/3.x/extensions/algolia/how-to/magento1) for
  more details.
- `standalone`: in this _flavor_, the extension is configured to work on custom
  indices. This is an advanced behavior. See
  [the corresponding How-to](/docs/3.x/extensions/algolia/how-to/standalone) for
  more details.

:::caution Known issue

The Algolia extension definition needs to appear before the one for Magento (1
or 2) in the `extensions` array.

:::

For instance, in a Magento 2 based project where the Algolia Magento 2 module is
installed on Magento side, the `front-commerce.config.ts` file would be
something like:

```typescript title="front-commerce.config.ts for a Magento2 based project"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/config";
import themeChocolatine from "@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine";
import magento2 from "@front-commerce/magento2";
// highlight-next-line
import algolia from "@front-commerce/algolia";
import storesConfig from "./app/config/stores";
import cacheConfig from "./app/config/caching";

// highlight-start
// depending on your setup, it can also be "magento1" or "standalone"
// see corresponding how-tos
const algoliaFlavor = "magento2";
// highlight-end

export default defineConfig({
  extensions: [
    // highlight-next-line
    algolia(algoliaFlavor), // ⚠️ need to be before magento2()
    magento2({ storesConfig }),
    themeChocolatine(),
  ],
  stores: storesConfig,
  cache: cacheConfig,
  configuration: {
    providers: [],
  },
});
```
