title: Add a shipping method with pickup points
description:
  In this guide, we'll go through the steps needed to retrieve pickup points
  from GraphQL and display them in a Map using Front-Commerce's component.

import ContactLink from "@site/src/components/ContactLink";

This method can also be useful if you are planning to set up a Store Locator in
your shop.

If you are willing to display these pickups in the checkout this guide will help
you. However if you are willing to save the needed information in the user's
quote, please have a look at
[Custom Shipping Information](/docs/advanced/shipping/custom-shipping-information)
instead.

<SinceVersion tag="2.1" />

:::info Prerequisite

To go through this guide, you'll need to have a created a
[new GraphQL module](/docs/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema) and to know how
to
[fetch data in a component](/docs/essentials/create-a-business-component#fetching-our-data).

:::

## Add pickups to your GraphQL Schema

The goal here is to be able to fetch a list of pickups from GraphQL. You could
create your own types and your custom implementation. However, in
Front-Commerce, we've created a GraphQL interface named `FcPickup` that ensures
that any pickup point can be displayed in the PostalAddressSelector component of
Front-Commerce.

### 1. Declare your custom pickup points in your GraphQL module

```graphql
type CustomPickup implements FcPickup {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  address: FcPostalAddress!
  coordinates: GeoCoordinates!
  schedule: FcSchedule
}

extend type Query {
  customPickupList: [CustomPickup]
}
```

Feel free to add any parameters to your query. It can for instance be useful to
use an address parameter to filter based on the location of the user. You can
use the `FcPostalAddressInput` for this usecase. It would look like this:

```graphql title='src/server/modules/shipping/schema.gql'
extend type Query {
  pickupList(
    "The shipping address"
    address: FcPostalAddressInput!
  ): [CustomPickup]
}
```

Moreover, the fields listed in the `CustomPickup` type are compulsory and come
from `FcPickup`. But if you need more, feel free to add them to your
`CustomPickup` type.

Once you've created your schema, you can import it in your GraphQL module.

```js title='src/server/modules/shipping/index.js'
import typeDefs from "./schema.gql";

export default {
  namespace: "CustomShipping/Magento1",
  dependencies: ["Front-Commerce/Shipping"],
  typeDefs,
};
```

:::info Important

Since we're using the `FcPickup` interface and other types coming from
Front-Commerce's core. Make sure to add the `Front-Commerce/Shipping` >
[dependency in your GraphQL's module declaration](/docs/reference/graphql-module-definition#dependencies-optional).

:::

### 2. Add a loader

You will now have to create a loader that returns the list of pickups. Let's say
it's named `CustomShippingLoader` and has a function named `loadPickupList`.
Then this list needs to be formatted following the GraphQL types used
previously. You would have something like this:

```js title="src/server/modules/shipping/loaders.js"
// Please keep in mind that this formatting function is an example
// and needs to be adapted to your usecase. The goal is to have the
// same guys, but with the correct values.
const formatPickupPoint = (pickupPoint) => {
  return {
    id: pickupPoint.id,
    name: pickupPoint.name,
    address: {
      country: pickupPoint.countryCode,
      locality: pickupPoint.city,
      postalCode: pickupPoint.zipcode,
      streetAddress: pickupPoint.street,
      // If your address doesn't need any additional information,
      // you can use the DefaultPostalAddress type. This is the
      // default implementation of the interface FcPostalAddress.
      // If you're unsure, use it, it's a safe bet.
      __typename: "DefaultPostalAddress",
    },
    coordinates: {
      latitude: pickupPoint.latitude,
      longitude: pickupPoint.longitude,
    },
    schedule: {
      monday: pickupPoint.schedule.monday,
      tuesday: pickupPoint.schedule.tuesday,
      wednesday: pickupPoint.schedule.wednesday,
      thursday: pickupPoint.schedule.thursday,
      friday: pickupPoint.schedule.friday,
      saturday: pickupPoint.schedule.saturday,
      sunday: pickupPoint.schedule.sunday,
    },
  };
};

const CustomShippingLoader = () => {
  return {
    loadPickupList: async () => {
      const response = await axios.get("/your-remote-api");
      return response.data.map(formatPickupPoint);
    },
  };
};
```

The API can live anywhere. It can come from your backend, a shipping service, or
a CMS, as long as it returns pickup points.

Once you've created your loader, you can register it in your GraphQL module:

```diff title="src/server/modules/shipping/index.js"
import typeDefs from "./schema.gql";
+import CustomShippingLoader from "./loaders";

export default {
  namespace: "CustomShipping/Magento1",
  dependencies: [
    "Front-Commerce/Shipping",
  ],
  typeDefs,
+  contextEnhancer: ({ req, loaders }) => {
+    const CustomShipping = CustomShippingLoader(axiosInstance);
+
+    return {
+      CustomShipping,
+    };
+  },
};
```

### 3. Use your loader in a resolver

```js title="src/server/modules/shipping/resolvers.js"
export default {
  Query: {
    pickupList: (parent, args, { loaders }) =>
      loaders.CustomShipping.loadPickupList(address),
  },
};
```

```diff title="src/server/modules/shipping/index.js"
import typeDefs from "./schema.gql";
import CustomShippingLoader from "./loaders";
import resolvers from "./reslovers";

export default {
  namespace: "CustomShipping/Magento1",
  dependencies: [
    "Front-Commerce/Shipping",
  ],
  typeDefs,
+  resolvers
};
```

### 4. Test your API in your playground

By now, if you've registered your module in your `.front-commerce.js` and
restarted the server, you should be able to retreive the pickup list from
GraphQL.

```graphql
query PickupListQuery($address: FcPostalAddressInput!) {
  pickupList(address: $address) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Display the list of pickup points

Now that you have the list of pickup points available in GraphQL, it is now
possible to display them in your application. This can be done by using the
component `theme/components/organisms/PostalAddressSelector`.

To do so, you need to first retreive the list of pickup from GraphQL. This can
be done by using this query:

```graphql
#import "theme/components/organisms/PostalAddressSelector/PostalAddressSelectorFragment.gql"

query PickupListQuery {
  pickupList {
    ...PostalAddressSelectorFragment
  }
}
```

The fetched data, then needed to be passed to your component by using the
`graphql` HOC.

```js
import { graphql } from "react-apollo";
import PickupListQuery from "./PickupListQuery.gql";
import PostalAddressSelector from "theme/components/organisms/PostalAddressSelector";

const PickupList = ({ loading, error, locations }) => {
  const [activeLocation, setActiveLocation] = useState(null);
  const [activeLocationIntention, setActiveLocationIntention] = useState(null);

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  if (error) {
    return <div>Error...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <PostalAddressSelector
      activeLocation={activeLocation}
      activeLocationIntention={activeLocationIntention}
      setActiveLocation={setActiveLocation}
      setActiveLocationIntention={setActiveLocationIntention}
      locations={locations}
    />
  );
};

export default graphql(PickupListQuery, {
  props: ({ data }) => {
    return {
      loading: data.loading,
      error: !data.loading && data.error,
      locations: data.pickupList ?? [],
    };
  },
})(PickupList);
```

Please note here that we're using the `activeLocation` and the
`activeLocationIntention`. The difference between those two is that the
`activeLocation` is only set if the user explicitly clicked on the button that
allows them to choose a pickup point. The intention is triggered if they've
clicked on the map's marker or on the address of the pickup. This allows to fine
tune the UX depending on your pickup selector needs.

`activeLocation` though is entirely optional and you can rely on
`activeLocationIntention` instead.

## Final words

Please keep in mind that this feature is built for shipping purpose in priority.
This means that you may need additional work to make it work with a custom store
locator page for instance. But it shouldn't be too much work and would allow you
to have the same behaviors in both your store locator and your checkout.

Moreover, by using this method, this also means that you are only a step away
from adding a click & collect shipping method (provided you have the existing
logistics in your business).

use cases.
