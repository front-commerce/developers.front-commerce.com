title: Customize response HTTP headers
description:
  Front-Commerce leverages helmet to send security-related HTTP headers. This
  guide explains how to customize those HTTP headers.

As mentioned in [helmet's README file](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet):
"_It's not a silver bullet, but it can help_" preventing security issues. Here
is how to change HTTP headers sent by your application.

## `Content-Security-Policy` (_aka_ CSP)

According to
[Content Security Policy (CSP) MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP):

> Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to
> detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting
> (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from
> data theft to site defacement to distribute malware.

In a nutshell, the `Content-Security-Policy` header instructs the browser on how
it should handle resources such as JavaScript, CSS, images, … or anything it can
load on a page.

In Front-Commerce, the content of this header can be controlled by tweaking
[`contentSecurityPolicy` configuration into `config/website.js`](/docs/reference/configurations#configwebsitejs).
This is where you will be able to let the browser know that for instance it can
safely load a JavaScript file from a given origin.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (_aka_ CORS)

According to
[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS):

> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that
> allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than
> its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

In a nutshell, <abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Sharing">CORS</abbr> headers
instructs browsers and remote services whether they're allowed to load a
specific content or not. This check usually happens with
[an `OPTIONS` HTTP preflight request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request).

A typical error you might encounter would be:

> Access to font at
> 'https://example.com/public/fonts/my-font.priority.xxxx.woff2' from origin
> 'https://other.example.org' has been blocked by CORS policy: No
> 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

**In Front-Commerce, the content of this header can be controlled by customizing
the `cors.origin` configuration** from the
[`corsConfigProvider`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/src/server/express/withGlobalHeaders.js#L13).

You must do it from a custom configuration provider. See the
[Register a configuration provider](/docs/advanced/server/configurations#register-a-configuration-provider)
guide to learn how to register it in your application.

Here is an example allowing browsers to load your pages from
`webcache.googleusercontent.com` and `other.example.org` domains:

```js
const corsOverrideConfigProvider = {
  name: "corsOverride",
  values: Promise.resolve({
    cors: {
      // This value is the one transmitted to the cors() middleware
      // see https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors#configuration-options for details
      origin: {
        googleCache: "webcache.googleusercontent.com",
        otherSite: "other.example.org",
      },
    },
  }),
};

configService.insertAfter("cors", corsOverrideConfigProvider);
```

:::tip

You can test headers returned from a specific origin by using the `Origin` HTTP
header. Example:

```shell
curl -sI https://example.com/ \
  -H "Origin:webcache.googleusercontent.com" \
  | grep -i access-control
```

:::

## Other headers

To customize other headers send by default, you have to write a custom express
middleware.

For instance, here is how you can to set
[the `Referer-Policy` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)
to `origin-when-cross-origin`:

1. [create module and add a `server/module.config.js` to declare a global server middleware](/docs/advanced/server/add-http-endpoint#add-a-global-server-middleware).
   This file would look like:

   ```js title="server/module.config.js"
   import setReferrerPolicy from "./express/setReferrerPolicy";

   export default {
     endpoint: {
       __dangerouslyOverrideBasePathChecks: true,
       path: "/",
       router: setReferrerPolicy,
     },
   };
   ```

1. write the middleware that will set the header. In this middleware, you can
   use any of the function
   [exposed by helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/#reference).

   ```js title="server/express/setReferrerPolicy.js"
   // imported in the previous snippet
   import { Router } from "express";
   import { referrerPolicy } from "helmet";

   const setReferrerPolicy = () => {
     const router = new Router();

     router.use(referrerPolicy({ policy: "origin-when-cross-origin" }));

     return router;
   };

   export default setReferrerPolicy;
   ```

And that's it. When the module having the `server/module.config.js` and
`server/express/setReferrerPolicy.js` files will be enabled in
`.front-commerce.js`, Front-Commerce will set the `Referrer-Policy` header to
`origin-when-cross-origin`.
