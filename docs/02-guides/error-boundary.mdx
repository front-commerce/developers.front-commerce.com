# Comprehensive Error Handling

Front-Commerce provides a robust error handling system that allows you to
gracefully manage errors at different levels of your application. This guide
will walk you through the process of implementing error boundaries and
customizing error pages to enhance your application's resilience and user
experience.

## Understanding Error Boundaries

Error boundaries in Front-Commerce are based on Remix's error handling
mechanism. They allow you to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child
component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the
component tree that crashed.

Front-Commerce offers three main types of error boundaries:

1. Root Error Boundary
2. Layout Error Boundary
3. Route-specific Error Boundary

## Root Error Boundary

The Root Error Boundary is the top-level error handler for your entire
application. It's typically defined in your `app/root.tsx` file.

To implement the Root Error Boundary:

1. Import the `RootErrorBoundary` component from Front-Commerce's theme:

   ```tsx
   import { RootErrorBoundary } from "theme/pages/Error";
   ```

2. Add the ErrorBoundary export to your `root.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   export const ErrorBoundary = RootErrorBoundary;
   ```

This will catch any unhandled errors in your application and display a generic
error page.

:::note

The `RootErrorBoundary` is wrapped in the `SimpleLayout` component.

## Layout Error Boundary

For routes that use a custom layout, you can implement a Layout Error Boundary.
This allows you to maintain your layout structure even when an error occurs.

Here is an example of how we use the LayoutErrorBoundary for the `_main.tsx`
layout:

1. Import the `LayoutErrorBoundary` component:

   ```tsx title="app/routes/_main.tsx"
   import { LayoutErrorBoundary } from "theme/pages/Error";
   ```

2. Use it within your layout component's ErrorBoundary:

   ```tsx title="app/routes/_main.tsx"
   export function ErrorBoundary() {
     // If this loader fails, it will be caught by the RootErrorBoundary
     const data = useRouteLoaderData<typeof loader>("routes/_main");
     const { headerNavigationMenu = [], footerNavigationMenu = [] } =
       data || {};

     return (
       <Layout
         headerNavigationMenu={headerNavigationMenu}
         footerNavigationMenu={footerNavigationMenu}
       >
         <LayoutErrorBoundary />
       </Layout>
     );
   }
   ```

This approach ensures that your layout remains intact while displaying the error
message.

:::note

The `LayoutErrorBoundary` is not wrapped in any layout as this is meant to be
used inside a route which is already wrapped in a layout.

## Customizing Error Pages

Front-Commerce allows you to customize error pages for specific HTTP status
codes. This is done through the `RouteResponseError` component and the
[`appErrorPages`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/5f23e92ac2008298dad36b72ae0066433d0311ae/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/pages/Error/appErrorPages.ts)
object.

### Adding Custom Error Pages

1. Create a new component for your custom error page, e.g.,
   `CustomNotFound.tsx`.
2. Add your custom error page to the `appErrorPages` object in
   [`theme/pages/Error/appErrorPages.ts`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/5f23e92ac2008298dad36b72ae0066433d0311ae/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/pages/Error/appErrorPages.ts):

   ```typescript title="theme/pages/Error/appErrorPages.ts"
   import CustomNotFound from "./CustomNotFound";

   export const appErrorPages = {
     404: CustomNotFound,
   } satisfies AppErrorPages;
   ```

3. The `RouteResponseError` component will now use your custom component for 404
   errors.

### Default Error Pages

Front-Commerce provides default error pages for common status codes:

- [429: Rate Limit Exceeded](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/2886bd9de6413411f89c7267252a95f45a55dd94/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/pages/Error/RateLimit/RateLimit.tsx)
- [503: Maintenance](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/83fe19855d18ed1a21693cb31c401e61f4ce8c79/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/pages/Error/Maintenance/Maintenance.tsx)
- [404: Not Found](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/67393729953ea2dabbd8ac8dae14e7e82fbdbcb5/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/modules/PageError/NotFound/NotFound.jsx)

You can override these by adding your own components to the
[`theme/pages/Error/appErrorPages.ts`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/5f23e92ac2008298dad36b72ae0066433d0311ae/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/pages/Error/appErrorPages.ts)
object.

## Best Practices

1. **Granular Error Handling**: Use route-specific error boundaries for handling
   errors that are unique to certain parts of your application.
2. **Informative Error Messages**: Provide clear and helpful error messages to
   guide users on what went wrong and what they can do next.
3. **Logging**: Implement proper error logging to help with debugging and
   monitoring application health.
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Design your error pages to maintain as much
   functionality as possible, allowing users to navigate away from the error or
   retry their action.
5. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent look and feel in your error pages to
   align with your application's overall design.

By following these guidelines and utilizing Front-Commerce's error handling
components, you can create a robust and user-friendly error management system
for your e-commerce application.
