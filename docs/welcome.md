Welcome to Front-Commerce’s official documentation. Even though
Front-Commerce is a proprietary product, we have decided to
maintain our documentation in the open.

**It means that you could understand how the product works and see
code samples before to help you decide whether Front-Commerce is
relevant for your project or not.**

It also means that you are encouraged to contribute to the documentation
and help us making it as good as possible. Keep [Uncle Bob’s famous « Boy Scout Rule »](http://wiki.c2.com/?BoyScoutRule)
in mind… any contributions is welcome (fixing a typo, adding troubleshooting, opening an issue to suggest new content).

Each page contains a direct « Edit » link to allow you to quickly suggest a change
or fix typo/grammar mistakes while reading it.

## Getting Help

If you need help or more information about a topic, there are different ways
[you can get help](/help.html).

## First Steps

Grasping all the concepts around a product such as Front-Commerce is exciting, but can
be intimidating. We tried to create and organize this documentation in a way that
you could quickly find the information you need depending on your context.

This documentation lives in a more global website for developers, so you might be
able to find more information in our [blog posts](/blog) or content pages.
