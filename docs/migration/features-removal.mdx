title: Features removal
description:
  This page lists the features that have been removed in `3.x` because they are
  irrelevant in the current context or were not used (we think).

import ContactLink from "@site/src/components/ContactLink";

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

:::note

If you are a Front-Commerce customer using one of this feature in your `2.x`
project, please <ContactLink>contact us</ContactLink> as you plan your migration
so we could reevaluate our decision.

## GraphQL Rate Limiting

In version 3.0, we removed the
[Rate Limiting](/docs/2.x/advanced/graphql/rate-limiting) feature from GraphQL.
Since GraphQL is not exposed through HTTP by default, the rate limiting feature
no longer makes sense at this level.

As a consequence, if you were using the following functions you must update your
codebase to remove these features:

- `limitRateByClientIp` for resolvers
- `rateLimiters` from the GraphQL context
- `config/rateLimit.js` configuration file
- `makeRateLimiters` internal API
- or a direct import from the `graphql-rate-limit` package

In the core, it was only used for the `sendContactEmail` mutation.

## `i18n-iso-countries` removal

In version 3.1, we removed all requirement for the `i18n-iso-countries` package,
we have replaced it with the
[`Intl.DisplayNames`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DisplayNames)
fir the
[getCountryName](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2757/diffs#7f314d01a79469d50021acfdb87dee953acfe36b)
function

As a consequence, If you have the
[`countries`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2757/diffs#69df4605bb5ca4175fa57a539a6978643da3b33c)
option in your `stores` configuration, you can remove it.
