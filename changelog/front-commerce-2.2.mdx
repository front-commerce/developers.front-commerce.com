## Guest Checkout

It is now possible to complete a Checkout in Front-Commerce without being
logged. This is a frequently asked feature as it can really boost your sales.
This also means that we've made all the changes necessary to the theme and that
the Guest Checkout for Magento 2 will be supported in our next release. Stay
tuned!

## More product types

In Front-Commerce we already supported simple products and configurable products
which are the most commonly used types in the Magento ecosystem. In
Front-Commerce's Magento 1 integration it is now possible to use Bundle Products
and Virtual Products.

Virtual products are especially exciting because this means that it is now
possible to completely remove the shipping step from the checkout if a customer
only buys virtual items.

Just like the Guest Checkout this also means that we're close to add the support
for these types in Magento 2's integration.

For Magento 2, we've added support for Grouped Products.

## Multiple currencies

In Magento there are multiple ways to sell your products in different
currencies. You can either configure a different website or set multiple
currencies on a single store. Each one has its pros and cons, but luckily for
you, we now support both ways in Magento 1.

Please refer to
[Multiple currencies](/docs/2.x/advanced/production-ready/multistore#Multiple-currencies)
for more details.

## Wordpress module reach 1.0

Since a few years, Front-Commerce allows to consume CMS content, blog posts and
other ACF data types from Wordpress. As part of this Front-Commerce release, we
took some time to clean things up and update the Wordpress module to leverage
new features added in Front-Commerce.

The Wordpress module now has an even wider coverage of native features such as
archives, categories, permalinks configuration and RSS feeds. We've improved
default SEO metadata and used Front-Commerce `<Wysiwyg>` and `<Image>`
components to bring performance and extensibility to Wordpress content too!

Don't want to choose? It is now possible to mix CMS pages from different
sources, so you could migrate progressively your content from Magento to
Wordpress.

## Other changes

- improved guest session invalidation
- support region fields in addresses as per Magento configuration rules
- support credit memos in Magento 1

  component along with DX to pinpoint obvious mistakes

  busy/unavailable during generation
