## Guest Checkout

Building on
[Front-Commerce 2.2's guest checkout support for Magento 1](/changelog/front-commerce-2.2/#Guest-Checkout),
it is now possible to complete a Checkout in Front-Commerce without being logged
for Magento 2 stores too!

This is a frequently asked feature as it can really boost your sales. In this
release, Customers can also register an account after placing an order as
guests.

We've also ensured in this release that **all Front-Commerce payment methods
were fully compatible with Guest Checkout**.

## More product types

As announced in our
[2.2 release announcement](/changelog/front-commerce-2.2/#More-product-types),
we've added support for **Bundle and Virtual products for Magento 2**.

This release also allows merchants to use **textual product custom options** for
their products.

## Customer reviews

Customer can now publish reviews from a product page. Reviews can be moderated
from Magento admin area as usual, and will be displayed upon acceptance.

## Adyen and BuyBox payment methods

Two new payment methods are available for your Front-Commerce store. Each one of
them uses new checkout workflows, which allowed us to make **Front-Commerce
checkout and payments even more flexible!**

For further details, visit our documentation pages for
[Adyen](/docs/advanced/payments/adyen) and
[BuyBox](/docs/advanced/payments/buybox).

## Log as a Customer

Magento administrators can now login as a Customer on their Front-Commerce
storefront. It was a **highly requested feature from merchants and customer
support teams**.

This feature is exciting as it builds on
[our Magento Admin detection feature (Front-Commerce 2.1)](/changelog/front-commerce-2.1/#Magento2-Admin-Detection)
to empower store owners in their day to day activities. Future Front-Commerce
releases will bring new features in that sense too.
