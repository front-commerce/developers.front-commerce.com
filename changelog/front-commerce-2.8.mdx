## Content-Driven Commerce with Prismic

eCommerce has evolved from a transactional process into a content-driven
experience. Marketers work hard to create superior content because it leads to a
superior Customer Experience.

In this release, we've improved our Prismic connector to serve this goal.
Developers can now leverage Prismic features in their Front-Commerce application
in many new ways:

- embrace Prismic's **"Don't Ship Pages, Ship a Page Builder"** vision with
  [Content Slices](/docs/prismic/content-slices) without sacrificing creative
  freedom
- improve the Content manager experience with
  [Integration Fields](/docs/prismic/integration-fields) to create rich content
  referencing any Front-Commerce data without leaving the writing room
  (Products, Categories, …)
- optimize SEO with [Routable types](/docs/prismic/routable-types). Expose
  custom Prismic content on any URL managed from Prismic and seamlessly include
  these pages in Front-Commerce's sitemap

These features are deeply integrated into Front-Commerce core features and
benefit from all the optimizations you already know (preloading, performant
images, …).

**We're excited to see what you build with it!**

## Unified Commerce with Proximis

Customers interact with brands in many different ways. We're partnering with
[Proximis](https://www.proximis.com/en) to bring
[the benefits of headless commerce](https://www.front-commerce.com/en/front-commerce-a-modern-ecommerce-architecture/)
to Retailers selling online and in store.

In this alpha release, we've made progress on every feature involved in the
customer journey (PLP, PDP, Cart, Store locator…). This connector will be
production ready before the end of the year.

[Contact us](https://www.front-commerce.com/en/contact-us/) to discuss your
project.

## Summer backlog cleaning

Front-Commerce 2.8 contains many different improvements and bugfixes. We've
scheduled some time to clean our backlog and reduce technical debt.

While some changes were related to our internal test suite, we also fixed
warnings and errors aggregated from Front-Commerce Cloud customers' logs. We've
also spent time on performance testing and profiled our server to optimize some
areas.

[Bugfixes](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/releases/2.8.0#bug-fixes)
will be backported to all 2.4+ Front-Commerce versions in the next few days, so
they can benefit all customers.

## Other changes

- custom order statuses are now displayed in the User account for Magento1
  projects
- it is now possible to customize the map boundaries without location
- multi-store setups with main URL and subdirectories for locales (e.g:
  https://example.com/ and https://example.com/fr) are now fully supported
- it is now possible to access the original image through the media proxy
  [with the `format=original` query parameter](/docs/advanced/production-ready/media-middleware#How-to-query-an-image)
- all shipping methods are now displayed for Magento1 shipping modules
  containing several methods (e.g: Owebia)

  [can now be deactivated](/docs/advanced/performance/deactivating-unnecessary-features#Deactivate-response-compression)
