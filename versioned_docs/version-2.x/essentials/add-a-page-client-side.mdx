title: Add a new page
description:
  Front-Commerce comes with a classic set of pages for an e-commerce
  application. It has URLs for Catalog routes (Categories, Product, Searchâ€¦),
  Checkout routes, Account routes, Cms pagesâ€¦ When building your own e-commerce
  experience you will most likely need to add your own pages/routes. That's what
  we will focus on in this guide.

We will take the example of a shop that is selling ingredients. It might make
sense for such a website to also present a bunch of recipes to inspire their
customers. Thus, we will add the needed routes to display:

- a page containing the list of all the recipes
- a page containing the details of one recipe

## Add a page using a static URL

First, let's add the page containing the list of all recipes. To do so you will
need to:

- Create the route file that will be mapped to a URL
- Declare your module as a web module

:::info

This system is inspired by JavaScript frameworks like
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/),
[Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), etc.
Implementing routing within Front-Commerce will be easier if you understand how
these work. See
[Routing reference](/docs/reference/routing#how-routes-are-loaded) for more
advanced information.

:::

### Create the route file that will be mapped to a URL

Create a route file in the folder `web/theme/routes/` of your module. If you
don't have a module yet, please refer to [Extend the theme](./extend-the-theme).

The url of your route will then depend on the name of the file you've created in
the `web/theme/routes/` folder. Thus, if we want to display a page at the URL
`/recipes`, we will create a file in `web/theme/routes/recipes.js` which will
export the component you want to display on this page.

```jsx title="web/theme/routes/recipes.js"
import React from "react";
import { H1 } from "theme/components/atoms/Typography/Heading";
import RecipesList from "theme/modules/Recipes/List";

const Recipes = () => (
  <div>
    <H1>Discover our recipes</H1>
    <RecipesList />
  </div>
);

export default Recipes;
```

:::note

Note that there is a `RecipesList` component here. It's a `business component`
that you can create by referring to
[Create a business component](/docs/essentials/create-a-business-component).

:::

We have decided here to put the file under `web/theme/routes/recipes.js`, but it
would have still worked if we've put it under
`web/theme/routes/recipes/index.js`. The page would still be displayed at the
URL `/recipes`.

### Declare your module as a web module

You have now declared that if your module's routes are loaded, it will display
the `Recipes` component at the URL `/recipes`. However, your module routes are
not loaded yet. You need to declare it in your `.front-commerce.js` file.

To do so, create an empty file in `web/index.js`. This is useful for module
resolution at the build level. Then add it as a webModule in your
`.front-commerce.js` file.

```js title="./front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  name: "Front Commerce DEV",
  url: "http://www.front-commerce.test",
  modules: ["./my-module"],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
  ],
  webModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "front-commerce/src/web/index.js" },
    // highlight-start
    { name: "MyWebModule", path: "./my-module/web/index.js" },
    // highlight-end
  ],
};
```

Once you're done, you can refresh your application (`npm run start`), and you
should see your new route if you go to the `/recipes` URL. ðŸŽ‰

:::warning

If several web modules are registered in your application and several of them
define the same route, the route of the last web module in `.front-commerce.js`
will be displayed. This can be useful if you want to override a default feature
of Front-Commerce.

:::

## Add a page using a URL with parameters

Now, let's add a `RecipeDetails` page that should be mapped to the
`/recipes/my-recipe-slug`. You will need to create the route file that will
match the URL. Since you have a parameter in the URL, you will need to put
brackets around it.

Thus, create a `RecipeDetails` component in
`web/theme/routes/recipes/[slug].js`. This will allow you to display the
`RecipeDetails` component in any url looking like `/recipes/.*`.

```jsx title="web/theme/routes/recipes/[slug].js"
import React from "react";
import { H1 } from "theme/components/atoms/Typography/Heading";
import Recipe from "theme/modules/Recipes/Details";

const RecipeDetails = (props) => (
  <div>
    <H1>
      You are looking at the recipe matching the slug {props.match.params.slug}
    </H1>
    <Recipe slug={props.match.params.slug} />
  </div>
);

export default RecipeDetails;
```

What's interesting to note here is that:

- anything that is between brackets in your file path will be transformed into a
  parameter available in `props.match.params.slug`
- you can create sub folders in your `web/theme/routes` folder if you want to
  have deeper URLs

You can now restart your application (`npm run start`) and you should see your
route `RecipeDetails` displayed at `/recipe/baguette`. ðŸ¥–ðŸŽ‰

:::note

Internally, this works by transforming any `/recipes/[slug]` kind of routes to
`/recipes/:slug`, which is then used by
[React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), a major routing
library in React's ecosystem.

## What about dynamic URLs?

If your URL can't be mapped to a pattern that can be transformed into filenames,
do not worry, we have got you covered! There is a second extension point in
Front-Commerce that allows you to achieve this: the `Dispatcher`.

[You can learn more about it in our advanced documentation.](/docs/advanced/theme/route-dispatcher)

## How can I share layouts between routes?

You might also wonder how can a route use the same layout as the other routes.
Front-Commerce handles this by using files like `_layout.js` or
`_inner-layout.js` in your routes.
