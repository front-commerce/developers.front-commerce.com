## Requirements

Front-Commerce is a **closed source product**. This documentation supposes that
you have access to our private repositories.

Access is granted to teams that have signed the relevant legal contracts, either
as a **Partner** or a **Customer**. Please <ContactLink /> if you need help or
further information.

:::info Important

you can find an exhaustive list of requirements and versions supported by
Front-Commerce in [our release notes](/docs/appendices/release-notes).

:::

You can check your versions by running these commands:

```shell
npm -v
node -v
```

If you don't have the minimum requirements,
[please follow the instructions on Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation using the skeleton

**This is the recommended way to start a new Front-Commerce project.**

[Front-Commerce’s skeleton repository](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce-skeleton)
provides a quick way to get started with Front-Commerce with sane default
configurations.

### Get the code

In order to install the skeleton, you need to follow these instructions:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="For npm >= 7">
```

```shell
git clone --depth=1 git@gitlab.blackswift.cloud:front-commerce/front-commerce-skeleton.git
cd front-commerce-skeleton
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="For npm < 7">
```

```shell
git clone --depth=1 git@gitlab.blackswift.cloud:front-commerce/front-commerce-skeleton.git
cd front-commerce-skeleton
npm install
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

Depending on your internet connection, feel free to grab some tea and a cookie…

### Configure the project

This skeleton comes with default values for most of the configuration. Below are
the configurations you will most likely have to change/create.

#### Configure the instance

Front-Commerce uses environment variables for runtime configurations depending
on the instance that runs (local, staging, production).

Copy the `.env.dist` sample file to a local `.env` and adapt uncommented
configurations. See the next paragraph to uncomment other configurations
depending on your context.

#### Configure remote services

Front-Commerce can interact with remote headless services. But for security
reasons, most services use some tokens to ensure that you are the only one to
access to their data. It also is a way to allow remote services to invalidate
Front-Commerce’s cache securely.

These kind of tokens are configured as environment variables (according to
[one of the 12-factor app principles](https://12factor.net/config)).

You will find an exhaustive list of available variables commented in the `.env`
file, with links to relevant documentation pages.

We invite you to dig into the remote services configurations and tweak them if
you wish. See
[our documentation](/docs/reference/environment-variables#remote-services-configuration)
for further information.

#### Configure stores

Configure the project by creating a `src/config/stores.js` file. It should be an
object with store codes as keys and configurations as values.

Here is an example:

```js
module.exports = {
  default: {
    locale: "en-GB",
    currency: "EUR",
    default_country_id: "GB",
    url: process.env.FRONT_COMMERCE_URL,
    countries: (IsoCountries) =>
      IsoCountries.registerLocale(require("i18n-iso-countries/langs/en.json")),
  },
};
```

See [Configure multiple stores](/docs/advanced/production-ready/multistore) for
further information.

:::info Magento

When using Front-Commerce with **Magento**, store codes must match
[Magento store view code](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/stores/stores-all-create-view.html).

:::

#### Optionally configure the caching strategy

To enable caching locally, you can configure it in `src/config/caching.js`. For
now only redis is supported, which requires to have a redis instance to connect
to.

See
[our caching section](/docs/advanced/graphql/dataloaders-and-cache-invalidation)
to know more about caching in the GraphQL middleware.

### Launch the application

Launch your Front-Commerce project in development mode by running:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="For node >= 17">
```

```shell
NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm run start
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="For node < 17">
```

```shell
npm run start
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.
You can also open
[http://localhost:4000/playground](http://localhost:4000/playground) to explore
the GraphQL schema and interact with its data.

:::info

The project will reload automatically in most cases upon a source code change.
However, when you are trying to override a file that already exists in one of
your modules, remember to restart this script.

:::

### Bonus: launch Storybook, our UI Development Environment

Front-Commerce is component based, and uses
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to allow developers to focus on building
components in isolation.

Storybook is a separate application that will render all
[the _stories_ written in your codebase](https://storybook.js.org/basics/writing-stories/)
so you can browse them. To launch it run the following command:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="For node >= 17">
```

```shell
NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm run styleguide
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="For node < 17">
```

```shell
npm run styleguide
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

You can now open [http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/) and explore
the existing components.

:::tip

You can configure which stories to display in your styleguide by setting the
[`styleguidePaths` key in your `.front-commerce.js` file](/docs/reference/front-commerce-js#styleguidepaths).
Its value should be a list of regexes (e.g: `[/.*.story.js$/];`) that will be
matched against your stories paths.
