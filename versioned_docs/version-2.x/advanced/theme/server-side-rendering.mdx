Front-Commerce uses <abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr> (opposed to

<abbr title="Client Side Rendering">CSR</abbr>) to improve
<abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> and
<abbr title="User experience">UX</abbr> by serving
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> pages to users on their
first hit to the server. You can read [A typical request in
Front-Commerce](/docs/2.x/concepts/architecture-overview#a-typical-request-in-front-commerce)
to get a better understanding of this process.

To generate this HTML page, Front-Commerce will render the React application as
a string. Your React components will trigger Apollo queries that will “fetch”
data from the GraphQL layer during this process. It may hit remote APIs and
finally generate the HTML content of your page from the data.

**While we try to make this process as smooth as possible for developers, so you
don’t have to worry about the technical details, there are some things that you
should be aware of while creating your theme.**

This section details everything frontend developers must keep in mind when
authoring components in a <abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr> context

## There is no `window` on the server!

Even though it may seem obvious, **you are very likely to come across this
problem at some point!** Browser APIs are not available during

<abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr>. Keep it in mind when using them,
and provide a graceful fallback.

Sometimes, it could be as simple as a default value or returning earlier from
your function without any side effect.

Examples:

```js
const doSomethingWithIntersectionObserver = () => {
  if (typeof window === "undefined" || !window.IntersectionObserver) {
    return;
  }
  // …
};
```

```js
const initializePosition = (setPosition) => {
  if (typeof navigator === "undefined" || !("geolocation" in navigator)) {
    setPosition(DEFAULT_LATITUDE, DEFAULT_LONGITUDE);
  } else {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
      setPosition(position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude);
    });
  }
};
```

## `branchServerClient` to the rescue!

There may be situations were displaying a totally different component during the
server rendering might be relevant.

For instance, instead of displaying a map centered on the user geolocation it
might be better to render a placeholder (page skeleton) on the server and load
the map with additional data during

<abbr title="Client Side Rendering">CSR</abbr>. Another use case would be to
avoid an unnecessary overhead by not rendering some components during
<abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr>: a social media feed may not make
sense on the server.

Front-Commerce provides a `branchServerClient`

<abbr title="Higher Order Component">HOC</abbr> that allow you to conditionally render
a component or another one on server and client side.

Example:

```js
import branchServerClient from "web/core/branchServerClient";

const MyClientSideComponent => props => <div>Hi!</div>;

export default branchServerClient(
  () => () => null, // do not render anything during SSR
  BaseComponent => BaseComponent // render the base component on the client
)(MyClientSideComponent);
```

Please keep in mind that by default the server version will always be displayed
first. This means that if you are on a category page and navigate to a product
page, it will first display the server version of the product page. When it's
done loading, it will then display the client version. The goal here is to
enable faster navigation and display only critical information on page mount.

If you want to change this behavior and display the client version of the
branch, you can use **`branchServerClient`'s third parameter** to pass the
`{ preferClientSide: true }` option.

:::info Tip

The function name (branch**Server**_Client_) is a good way to remember that the
first parameter is what is rendered on the **server**, and the second on the
_client_.

:::

If you only need to know the rendering context, you can use Front-Commerce's
`withIsServer` HOC to have an `isServer` prop injected in your component.

Example:

```js
import { withIsServer } from "web/core/branchServerClient";

const MyIsomorphicComponent => props => <div>
  My latest render occured on the {props.isServer ? "server" : "client" }.
</div>;

export default withIsServer()(MyIsomorphicComponent);
```

:::tip ProTip™

In order to reduce the amount of Javascript sent to users, we've found that code
using `branchServerClient()` are often good candidates to code splitting. You
may consider using a `loadable()` component here. You can use
[`DEBUG="front-commerce:webpack"`](/docs/2.x/reference/environment-variables#debugging)
to analyze your bundles and decide wether it would improve your application or
not.

## A viewport as consistent as possible

<SinceVersion tag="2.0.0-rc.0" />

When using the `<MediaQuery>` component (a thin wrapper around
[`react-responsive`'s component](https://github.com/contra/react-responsive#with-components),
available in `"theme/components/helpers/MediaQuery"`), Front-Commerce has to
decide which viewport width to use during

<abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr>.

We decided to use
[User-Agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent)
based detection in order to choose a width. Even though it might not be perfect
(the best solution still is to use CSS media queries as much as possible over
render-time media queries with the above component) we think it brings a good
user experience.

This behavior is leveraging
[Front-Commerce's configuration system](/docs/2.x/advanced/server/configurations)
to provide information about the device. Each `req.config` will contain a
`device` key with the following information that you can use to if needed:

```js title="req.config.device"
{
  // User-Agent detection is memoized for each header value for this amount of time
  memoizationMaxAge: ONE_MINUTE_IN_MS,
  type: "phone", //  ["phone", "tablet", "pc", "tv", "bot"]
  viewportWidthInPx: 360
}
```

If you want to tweak this behavior, we invite you to browse the
[`deviceConfigProvider`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/784684ce56cca69ca5c2e42d5d421a8c0b4bb9c3/src/server/express/ssr/deviceConfigProvider.js)
for implementation details and <ContactLink /> if you think of any improvements.

## SSR Fallback when things go wrong

<SinceVersion tag="2.0.0-rc.0" />

During <abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr> you might face some errors
(syntax errors,
[browser API usage](/docs/2.x/advanced/theme/server-side-rendering#there-is-no-window-on-the-server),
render errors, etc.). By default in dev mode, Front-Commerce provides an error
page that makes the mistake obvious to allow you to fix it as early as possible.

Hopefully the previous screen will prevent such errors to occur in production,
but development is not an exact science and things can go wrong! In such
situations, the `theme/pages/SsrFallback` component will be rendered instead of
the page. **It displays a clean loading area, but you can override it to provide
another visual waiting page to users while the application is being rendered
client side.**

If you still want to display the `theme/pages/SsrFallback` page in dev mode,
[add `FRONT_COMMERCE_DEV_SSR_FALLBACK_DISABLE=true` to your environment variables](/docs/2.x/reference/environment-variables#dx).

## Restrictions on pages that will be server-rendered

<SinceVersion tag="2.8" />

Front-Commerce avoids to unnecessary render a full 404 page server-side for URLs
that don't need it. When bots access random URLs (e.g: `dump.sql.gz`,
`password.txt` etc…) or outdated static assets, Front-Commerce will return a
simpler 404 error.

Pages are server-rendered when accessed with the following URL patterns:

- without extension (e.g: `/contact`, `/faq/our-return-policy`…)
- with an `.html` extension (e.g: `/contact.html`,
  `/wooden-table-with-chairs.html`…)

**If your application contains pages whose URL have extensions other than
`.html`, please <ContactLink />.**
