We currently support the main features of Magento. You can consider that if it works in Magento 2, it will work with Front-Commerce!

- search and navigation using ElasticSearch
- multi-stores instances
- advanced pricing: coupon codes, promotion rules, taxes…
- highly customizable checkout, supporting Magento custom shipping and payment extensions
- account management (forgotten passwords, emails…)
- SEO: clean urls, redirections, sitemaps, meta information and rich data

In this section, you will learn information about Magento 2 integration with Front-Commerce.

- [Magento’s GraphQL support in Front-Commerce](/docs/magento2/graphql.html)
