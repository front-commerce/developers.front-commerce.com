title: Migration Guides

This area will contain the Migration steps to follow for upgrading your store to new Front-Commerce versions.

Our goal is to make migrations as smooth as possible. This is why we try to make many changes backward compatible by using deprecation warnings. The deprecation warnings are usually removed in the next breaking release.

## `1.0.0-beta.3` -> `2.0.0-rc.0`

`1.0.0-beta.4` and `1.0.0-beta.5` versions were bugfixes releases which required to be done so that some projects could move forward. It was safe and seamless to update to these versions.

If you are migrating from a `1.0.0-beta.3` version to the `2.0.0-rc.0`, here is the guide.

### Linting

The previous linting was usually linting your code AND Front-Commerce's code which was a waste of time. This is no longer the case and you can lint your code however you want.

But if you don't want to have complicated eslint configurations, you can use Front-Commerce's by creating a `.eslintrc.js` file at the root of your project with the following code:

```
module.exports = require("front-commerce/.eslintrc.js");
```

You can now launch the linting by using `npx front-commerce lint`.

Please note that we no longer use prettier by default in the eslint configuration. It is instead executed when running `npx front-commerce lint`.

> You can still use `npx front-commerce lint --fix` if you want to fix prettier or eslint errors automatically.

This also means that you can now upgrade prettier to its latest version without breaking Front-Commerce's tooling.

### Avoid commonjs syntax

The linting will now prevent you from using commonjs syntax in your project. You should instead use the ES modules syntax (`import`/`export`).

This will allow better tree shaking and a better validation of your builds in the future. This is also what allows us to upgrade to the latest dependencies for the libraries used in Front-Commerce.

### Dependencies upgrade

We've been accumulating technical debt about upgrading the libraries Front-Commerce depends on for a bit of time because our server code mixed syntaxes between commonjs and ES modules. This means that we now have upgraded everything to their latest version and you will need to update your code accordingly.

Here the list of the main updates you need to be concerned about:
* react and react-dom: `16.8.6` -> `16.8.9`
  New deprecations have been put in place by React itself. We've fixed them in Front-Commerce, but you will most likely have them in your own codebase. Please update your code accordingly. [Details](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/08/react-v16.9.0.html#new-deprecations)
* [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer): `6.7.6` -> `9.6.1`
  Please define your [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) in package.json. For instance it could look like this:
  ```
  "browserslist": [
    "last 2 version",
    "> 0.25%",
    "not ie <= 9",
    "Firefox ESR"
  ]
  ```
* [formsy-react](https://github.com/formsy/formsy-react): `0.20.1` -> `1.1.5`
  It should be compatible. However you will have warnings if you use `formsy-react-2`. Simply rename it to `formsy-react`. Please have a look at the [Abstract Formsy section](#Abstract-Formsy) below to learn about broader changes regarding the form inputs.
* [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) -> [react-helmet-async](https://github.com/staylor/react-helmet-async)
  It should be compatible. However you will have warnings if you use `react-helmet`. Simply rename it to `react-helmet-async`. The goal is to have a better SSR support.
* [react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl): `2.4.0` -> `3.2.3`
  It should be compatible for the use cases in FC. If you use specific features, please check them and fix them.
  FormattedMessage no longer insert spans around your messages. This might lead to some styling issues. Add manually a `span` around your message if this is the case.
* [react-paginate](https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate): `5.0.0` -> `6.3.0`
  It should be compatible [unless you were using `breakLabel`](https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate/blob/master/HISTORY.md#-600).
* [react-responsive](https://github.com/contra/react-responsive): `3.0.0` -> `8.0.1`
  Should be compatible since we are using a facade in FC `theme/components/helpers/MediaQuery`. If you are using something else, please make sure your code still works.
* [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/): `4.3.1` -> `5.0.1`
  See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/releases/tag/v5.0.0) for more details.
  * Make sure that you always import your components from the `react-router` or `react-router-dom` and no longer use `react-router/XXX` or `react-router-dom/XXX`.
  * You no longer have access to the old context. Please use `withRouter` or `<Route />` instead.
* [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose): `0.26.0` -> `0.30.0`
  `mapPropsStream` works but triggers warnings because of `react@16.9.0`.
  Please use `web/core/utils/mapPropsStream.js` instead.
* migration of [loadable-components](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components)@1.1.1 -> [@loadable/component](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components)@5.10.2
  * Rename your imports to `@loadable/component`
  * Rename `LoadingComponent` to `fallback`
  * Use an ErrorBoundary rather than the `ErrorComponent`
  * Add `%%__HEAD__%%` and `%%__SPLIT__%%` to your `template/index.html` if you have one.

### Display error pages

Error pages now have their own template: `template/error.html`. Please override it in your module if you need to customize it.

This template is used for the following pages:

* Offline
* Maintenance (503)
* ServerError (500)

### Better SSR fallback

Previously, when the SSR failed, we displayed a "Loading..." string before trying to render the page client side. This is no longer the case. We instead display the `theme/pages/SsrFallback` component which is overridable. You could for instance replace it with a custom loader.

Please note that in dev mode, this page won't show and you will get an error message instead. The goal here is to catch the errors early and make sure that things keep running smoothly. If you happen to stumble upon these errors, please fix them by checking your server's console.

If you still want to display the `theme/pages/SsrFallback` in dev mode, add `FRONT_COMMERCE_DEV_SSR_FALLBACK_DISABLE=true` to your environment variables.

### Responsive images

Your previous images will still work. However we have added a new component in `theme/components/atoms/Image` that will always give the proper image size to your browser.
* Supports srcset and webp
* Improved lazy loading
* Same API as `<ResizedImage />`
* Improved DX by explicitly failing in dev mode and failing silently in production mode

We will migrate progressively the components in Front-Commerce's core, but feel free to start migrating your own code for improved performance and UX.

Only thing to consider: if you had some images in one of your `public/images/resized` folder, they will no longer work in dev mode because these images will be resized on the fly just like your images at the `/media` endpoint. However, in your production environment you will still see the image.

TODO: Document how to add your own proxy endpoint.

### Abstract Formsy

The goal here is to allow an easier migration out of Formsy.

If you don't plan to move out of it, you don't need to change anything. However, if you want to keep your codebase up to date with Front-Commerce, please consider using `withFormHandlers` instead of `withFormsy`.

Please note that some improvements comes with `withFormHandlers`. The most notable change is that inputs won't display errors on first user's change, but on the first blur. This should make form completion less frustrating for the users. The second change is that you can decide to opt-out of `Formsy` any time by passing an `onChange` property directly.

For more information, please have a look at [how to create new input types](/docs/advanced/theme/form.html#New-input-types).

For existing projects, the goal would be to replace `formsy-react`'s HOC by `withFormHandlers`. The best way to migrate components you have overriden in your project is to look at the core's implementation of form inputs like [`Input`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/720ac5e4c5dc28850b0fbdf1c02705b48d7610a1/src/web/theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Input.js), [`Textarea`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/720ac5e4c5dc28850b0fbdf1c02705b48d7610a1/src/web/theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Textarea/Textarea.js), [`Checkbox`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/720ac5e4c5dc28850b0fbdf1c02705b48d7610a1/src/web/theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Checkbox/Checkbox.js) or [`Select`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/720ac5e4c5dc28850b0fbdf1c02705b48d7610a1/src/web/theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Select/Select.js).

### Move to a file first routing declaration

Previously, if you needed to use new routes or sub-routes, you needed to do one of the following:

* override the `web/Routes.js` file
* add the route using the `web/moduleRoutes.js` file
* or declare sub-routes in existing pages

This led to several issues:

* developers needed to handle code splitting themselves, which could led to bigger initial javascript load
* it was hard to have a global vision of the existing routes in a Front-Commerce application
* Front-Commerce couldn't optimize page loads by preloading components or data since nothing mapped an URL to a route

This is why we've decided to implement the solution available in many Javascript Frameworks: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs#routing), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/routing/), [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing/), [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Pages), etc.

The TL;DR of the new routing system is that you now have a `web/theme/routes` folder available in your modules which can contain 5 kind of files:
* normal routes files like `about.js` which will map the exported component to the `/about` url
* `index.js`: maps the exported component to the `/` url
* `_layout.js`: wraps the routes in the same folder with the exported component
* `_inner-layout.js`: wraps the routes in the same folder with the exported component but won't discard the parent's layout
* `_error.js`: exports the component that will displayed in case there's a 404 error or if one of the component does not manage to render

For more information, please have a look at the [Routes reference](/docs/reference/routing.html).

<details>
<summary>What should you do to implement this new routing system in your existing project? <strong>Click to expand.</strong></summary>

1. If you already have a `web/index.js` file in your module, rename it to `web/client.js`
2. Add Front-Commerce's web module to your project in `.front-commerce.js`
    ```diff
    module.exports = {
      name: "Front Commerce DEV",
      url: "http://www.front-commerce.test",
      modules: ["./src"],
      serverModules: [
        { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
        { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" }
    -  ]
    +  ],
    +  webModules: [{ name: "FrontCommerce", path: "front-commerce/src/web" }]
    };
    ```
3. If you have some custom routes, declare your own routes by:
    * Creating an empty `web/index.js` file
    * Add your own web module to `.front-commerce.js`
        ```diff
        module.exports = {
          name: "Front Commerce DEV",
          url: "http://www.front-commerce.test",
          modules: ["./src"],
          serverModules: [
            { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
            { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" }
          ],
        -  webModules: [{ name: "FrontCommerce", path: "./src/web" }]
        +  webModules: [
        +    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "front-commerce/src/web" },
        +    { name: "MyModule", path: "./src/web" },
        +  ]
        };
        ```
4. Find any page that uses the `Route` component from `react-router`. Here are a few pointer about how to migrate those files. However, if you're not sure or if you have trouble making it work, feel free to reach our team. We will make sure to make this as painless as possible.
    * If it's `web/moduleRoutes.js`, it will continue to work, but is deprecated. Please create a route file per `<Route>` as described in [Add a page client side](/docs/essentials/add-a-page-client-side.html)
    * If it's a file that does not exist in Front-Commerce's core, this most likely means that the component should be a layout and the associated routes should be new files created in your `web/route` folder.
    * If it's a file you've overridden from Front-Commerce's core, please check in the core how the file changed. If it's still used, the `<Route>` components have most likely been replaced with the children property. If it's not, it usually means that it is now replaced by a layout. If you're not sure, feel free to contact our team. We will make sure to make this as painless as possible.
</details>

### Better sitemap declarations

First things first, if you didn't customize the sitemap, you can skip this section. If you did though, you will need to change the way you customized the Sitemap loader.

Previously, in order to change the sitemap loader, you had to override the default resolver for `Query.sitemap` and add your own nodes to the default ones. From now on, you will instead need to register nodes dynamically. Please follow the [Sitemap guide](/docs/advanced/theme/sitemap.html#Add-your-own-routes-in-the-sitemap) for more details.

## `1.0.0-beta.0` -> `1.0.0-beta.3`

`1.0.0-beta.1` and `1.0.0-beta.2` versions were bugfixes releases which required to be done so that some projects could move forward. It was safe and seamless to update to these versions.

If you are migrating from a `1.0.0-beta` version to the `1.0.0-beta.3`, here is the guide.

### HTTPS

We wanted to explicitly prevent usage of Front-Commerce in production mode in a non secured environment. From now on, accessing an application in production mode using the `http` protocol will automatically redirect to `https`.

If you experience issues after the upgrade, here are the things to ensure:

- start the application with the [`FRONT_COMMERCE_UNSAFE_INSECURE_MODE`](/docs/reference/environment-variables.html#Front-Commerce-related-variables) set to `true` to see if that solves your issue
- if the above manipulation worked, ensure that your proxy (if any) forwards the protocol using the `X-Forwarded-Proto` HTTP header

If you still experience issues, please [contact us](mailto:support@front-commerce.com).

### Embedded Payments

Previously, when a payment needed to set custom information, there were two steps: one for validating the payment information, and one for placing the order.

This is no longer the case, which improves the Customer experience. But this means that AddtionalPaymentInformation components need to use the new behavior, which is to use `theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/SubmitPayment` when validating the additional payment information.

You will need to do so if you are using Stripe or Payzen and have customized how these forms are displayed in an existing project. If you need help, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@front-commerce.com).

Please note that if you made some changes to some payments only because you wanted to change the submit button, this will no longer be needed. You will be able to remove your override, and only override `theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/SubmitPayment`. The additional benefit is that it will let you have the exact same submit button across all your payment methods.

### Magento 2 Authenticated Remote schema stitching

If you had a custom remote schema stitching module with Magento 2, you could reuse the authentication middleware from Front-Commerce to access resources under the currently logged in user by leveraging the [new HTTP headers customization feature](/docs/advanced/graphql/remote-schemas.html#Customize-remote-HTTP-requests).

Here is how it might look:

```diff
const { FilterRootFields } = require("graphql-tools");
+const authenticateRequest = require("server/modules/magento2-graphql/authenticateRequest");

const m2GraphQLEndpoint =
  process.env.FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ENDPOINT + "/graphql";

module.exports = {
  namespace: "Acme/Magento2GraphQL",
  dependencies: ["Magento2GraphQL"],
  remoteSchema: {
    uri: m2GraphQLEndpoint,
    transforms: [
      new FilterRootFields(
        (operation, rootField) =>
-          operation === "Query" && rootField === "myField"
+          operation === "Query" && rootField === "myField" ||
+          operation === "Query" && rootField === "customer"
      )
-    ]
+    ],
+    linkContextBuilders: [authenticateRequest()]
  }
};
```

## `1.0.0-alpha.2` -> `1.0.0-beta.0`

### Versions

We are now entering a `beta` phase.
Be sure to update your dependency as follow:

```
npm install --save git+ssh://git@gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce.git#semver:^1.0.0-beta
```

Same goes for the Magento 2 module.
Please update your PHP dependencies by using the latest beta in your Magento project.

<blockquote class="important">
  **IMPORTANT:** please ensure to keep your [`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_MODULE_VERSION`](/docs/reference/environment-variables.html#Magento-2) up-to-date in the `.env` file of your Front-commerce application.
  It should now be `1.0.0-beta`.
</blockquote>

### Translations

We have introduced the mechanism of [Translation Fallback](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/advanced/theme/translations.html#Translations-fallback). This is means that you will have fewer conflicts during next upgrades.

### Improved search experience

While working on our compatibility with Magento 2.3, we decided to use [ElasticSuite](https://elasticsuite.io/). Learn more about it in our [announcement](/blog/2019/05/07/release-1.0.0-beta.0/#Improved-search-experience).

During this change, we needed to update some parts of the GraphQL schema. If you don't use our implementation, this won't impact you. However, if you do, here is what changed in the schema:

* `AttributeBucket.swatch` was removed in favor of `AttributeBucket.productAttributeValue.swatch`. The reasoning behind this is that what's interesting is not the swatch itself but the whole attribute which is available at `AttributeBucket.productAttributeValue`.
* Layers related types are now interfaces (Bucket, DynamicFacet, FixedFacet) with concrete implementations (AttributeFacet...).
* `DynamicFacet.bucket` has been renamed in
`DynamicFacet.buckets` (plural).
* `SearchResult.layer` was renamed to `SearchResult.products`

Please check your front-end queries to ensure to update them accordingly. If you need any help about these, feel free to [contact us](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com).

### Wishlist

A basic wishlist is now available in Front-Commerce by default with the Magento2 module.
However, for existing shops, you need to check a few things in order to make sure that the wishlist is available for your customers. Indeed, the impacted components are likely to have been overridden.

1. Upgrade your `front-commerce/magento2-module` to version `1.0.0-beta.1` or higher.
    * make sure to update `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_MODULE_VERSION` accordingly
2. Check that the wishlist is available in the customer's account
    * the route must exist (`node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/pages/Account/Account.js`)
    * a link must in the account navigation (`node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/User/AccountNavigation/AccountNavigation.js`)
3. Check that the user can actually add the product to their wishlist
    * either on the product page itself (`node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/ProductView/Synthesis/Synthesis.js`)
    * or on the product item used for product listings (`src/web/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItemActions/ProductItemActions.js`)

### Storybook 5

Your styleguide is now powered by Storybook 5. This might have an impact on the organization of your custom stories but they will still appear in your styleguide.

To move your stories in the correct sections, please set your story name like this: `section|path.of.your.story.Component`

### Payments

#### Stripe

We have added an initial implementation of Stripe's embedded payments. This is still in early stage but will let your customers pay your order successfully. See [Stripe](https://github.com/front-commerce/developers.front-commerce.com/issues/47#issuecomment-476633486).

#### Integrations

Previously, some payment React components were loaded by default in the Checkout even though those payment methods were not used. This resulted in a heavier js bundle. This, we have removed those components by default.

If you relied on them, you will now need to add them manually. We are still in the process of documenting it, but you can find the main informations in [this issue](https://github.com/front-commerce/developers.front-commerce.com/issues/47) at the moment.

### Deprecations

* Environment variables from your `.env` will in the future be loaded dynamically. You won't need to rebuild your server to update your server's environment variables. To ensure that you have the newest behavior, please set `FRONT_COMMERCE_USE_SERVER_DYNAMIC_ENV=true`. To keep the deprecated one, please use `FRONT_COMMERCE_USE_SERVER_DYNAMIC_ENV=false`. See [How to update environment variables](/docs/reference/environment-variables.html#How-to-update-environment-variables).
* While upgrading the search behavior, we have also changed deprecated the `search.blacklistKeys` configuration in `config/website.js`. This now should be `search.ignoredAttributeKeys` which is less offensive and more explicit. Moreover, `search.fixedFacets` and `search.categoriesField` are no longer used.
* While upgrading the search behavior, we have split the core's search definition from the Magento 2's implementation. This means that future integrations will let you use different backends while keeping your frontend intact. We've grouped the core's search functionality in `server/modules/front-commerce/search`. This  means that we have also moved `server/modules/front-commerce-core` to `server/modules/front-commerce/core`. By default, `.front-commerce.js` should now use `server/modules/front-commerce`, in order to load both the core and the search.

## Branching model

Please note that from now on, all developments will happen on the main `master` branch.
If you want to be on the edge you must now use the `master` branch instead of the `develop` (now removed).

## `1.0.0-alpha.1` -> `1.0.0-alpha.2`

### GraphQL

[`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) has been updated to a new major version (0.13.2 -> 14.1.1) that includes several breaking changes.
There is only one breaking change that may impact your current application: scalar types are now checked more rigorously (see [the PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/1382)), meaning you may have to convert strings to numbers (etc.) in your application.

The symptoms are errors of this type in your application:

> Expected type Int; Int cannot represent non-integer value: "1"

See [v14.0.0’s releases notes](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/releases/tag/v14.0.0) for an exhaustive list of breaking changes and other minor releases for new features.

### Atoms refactoring ([#178](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/178))

One of the goals of `1.0.0` is to rewrite our CSS classes to make it easier for new external contributors to dive into Front-Commerce. However, this is a lot of work because of the many features already implemented in Front-Commerce. Thus, we've splitted this in 5 smaller iterations (see ([#97](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/97)) for more details). This release is the first step towards this goal.

This means that:

- CSS classes of atoms are no longer used directly in other components
- CSS classes of atoms now respect the BEM convention. However we are not too rigid about this convention because avoiding dependencies between components is our first priority. (Currently in the process of writing a documentation page explaining the whys behind this decision.)

On your part, the changes that will affect you the most are about the following components:

- `<Button>`: changed the classes and gathered the styles properties under an `appearance` property
- `<Link>`: changed the classes and use the classes of the `<Button>` if you use the `buttonAppearance` property.
  This is relevant because for UI reasons you might want to render a Button, but it should still redirect to a new page under the hood.
- `<ResizedImage>`: added a surrounding div and changed classes to better handle fluid vs fixed images.
  Moreover, you can now update only the components that handle the markup of a ResizedImage without overriding the core component. Please refer to `Image`, `ImageLoading` and `ImageNotFound` in `theme/components/atoms/ResizedImage` folder.
- `<Input>`: changed input classes
- `<NumberInput>`: changed the style to add +/- buttons next to the input button.

You should also check that if you have overridden some of the other components.

### Variant properties

For style variants of a component we had several behaviors in place:

- `type` property which was an enumeration of the variants
- `variantName` properties (for instance `primary` and `warning` for `<Button>`)

To improve consistency, we've decided to change this by always using an `appearance` property which will be an enumeration like what was done with the `type` property.

The goal is to avoid variants collision and to make it explicit when a variant only affects the style of a component.

These changes are backward compatible. Deprecation warnings will appear if you keep using the old properties.

### Files loading in a Scss file

Until now, files used in a `.scss` file were to be loaded from the public directory or by using long and tedious file paths. This is no longer the case. You can now use relative imports.

For instance, if you have a `theme/components/atoms/Icon/_Icon.scss` file, you will be able to import the font file directly:

```diff
-src: url('../theme/components/atoms/Icon/font-awesome-4.7.0/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
+src: url('./font-awesome-4.7.0/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
```

This is usually done for background-images and fonts. Please look for any `url` keyword in your scss files to make sure that you update your paths accordingly.

### Cart refactoring

The Cart was one of the most outdated part of our code. This is no longer the case! Components and styles have been refactored to better match the style of the checkout and account pages. This is a great step forward because it is rarely heavily customized by online shops and it will now be a nice default.

#### Translations

Since few integrators had the opportunity to customize the existing Cart, the main changes you will need to take care of are the translations.

<details>
<summary>List of the changed translations regarding the Cart</summary>

This process should be easier in the future by using [translations fallbacks that is under development](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/54#note_152801124).

#### Styles

If you have overridden the `theme/modules/_modules.scss` file and didn't import the `front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/_modules.scss` file, you will need to add the new styles for the Cart:

```diff
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/EmptyCart/EmptyCart";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartTitle/CartTitle";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartContent/CartContent";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartContent/CartHeader/CartHeader";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItem";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemInfos/CartItemInfos";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemStatus/CartItemStatus";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemQuantityForm/CartItemQuantityForm";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/MiniCartItem/MiniCartItem";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartFooter/CartFooter";
-@import "~theme/modules/Cart/ProductItemCart/ProductItemCart";
```

If you have overridden the `theme/components/_components.scss` file and didn't import the `front-commerce/src/web/theme/components/_components.scss` file, you will need to add the new styles for the new components that have been added for the Cart's modules:

```diff
+@import "~theme/components/atoms/Typography/Sku/Sku";
+@import "~theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/NumberInput/NumberInput";
+@import "~theme/components/molecules/Form/FormTitle/FormTitle";
```

### Checkout refactoring

The checkout was already pretty clean. Since it is a crucial part of any e-commerce application, we invested in it to make it a good default.

However, the Address components were a bit confusing in the Checkout because these were used in the Account too. To make it clearer for integrators, we've moved the generic Address components to `theme/modules/User/Address`. This means that in this folder you will now find:

* Address components (previously in `theme/components/molecules/Address`) to display an address in different formats
* Forms components (previously in `theme/modules/Checkout/Address`) to create, edit or remove an address
* EditableAddress  (previously in `theme/modules/Checkout/Address`) that lets you display an Address and lets the User edit and Address if they need to
