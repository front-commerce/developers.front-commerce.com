  Front-Commerce aims at making Magento developers productive by allowing them
  to work with what they know from Magento. This page explains how you could
  expose parts of the Magento GraphQL schema in your application.

import BrowserWindow from "@site/src/components/BrowserWindow";
import ContactLink from "@site/src/components/ContactLink";

In order to achieve this, our goal is to expose as much
[Magento’s GraphQL schema](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/graphql/) as
possible in Front-Commerce. We follow evolutions in Magento core very closely,
and aim at including the new stable parts of this schema in Front-Commerce **as
soon as they match the parts we’ve developed over the years in terms of feature,
performance and stability**.

This section details what is available so far.

:::note

Please note that it relies upon the
[GraphQL modules remote schema](/docs/2.x/advanced/graphql/remote-schemas)
support from Front-Commerce. We recommend to have at least a basic understanding
of how it works if you know Magento’s GraphQL schema and would like to find
yourself at home in Front-Commerce!

:::

## Enable Magento2 GraphQL module

Front-Commerce supports both Magento 2.2 and 2.3 versions. For this reason,
GraphQL support for Magento is not part of the default Magento2
[meta module](/docs/2.x/advanced/graphql/meta-modules).

To enable GraphQL support for Magento 2.3+, you must register the
`server/modules/magento2-graphql` module in your application.

To do so, add the following line in your
[`.front-commerce.js`](/docs/2.x/reference/front-commerce-js) file:

```js title=".front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  name: "Front-Commerce",
  url: "https://www.front-commerce.test",
  modules: [],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
    // highlight-next-line
    { name: "Magento2GraphQL", path: "server/modules/magento2-graphql" },
  ],
};
```

**Restart your server**, and you should now see the additional endpoints.

## Store configurations

The public store configurations are available under the
`Magento2GraphQL_storeConfig` query.

<BrowserWindow url="https://localhost:4000/playground">

```graphql
{
  Magento2GraphQL_storeConfig {
    timezone
  }
}
```

</BrowserWindow>

See
[the related Magento DevDocs page](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/graphql/reference/store-config.html)
to learn which configurations are exposed by default in Magento's schema.

## Is something missing?

As detailed earlier, Front-Commerce already supports a wide range of Magento
features. We believe that — to date — **most of the features from Front-Commerce
schema are more stable, performant and complete than Magento’s GraphQL
counterpart** (even if the schema is slightly different).

However, our goal is to reduce this gap (and our codebase!) and your feedback is
welcome. If you think something is missing in Front-Commerce, or stable enough
in Magento to be used in production, <ContactLink /> and we could add it to our
roadmap!
