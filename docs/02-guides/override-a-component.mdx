## Understanding theme overrides

Front-Commerce web application is a fully featured e-commerce
[universal](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9)
React application aimed at providing a sane base for your own theme. Even though
you could reuse pages and components individually in a totally different theme,
most of the time you might find easier and faster to start with the a theme and
iterate from there.

**Theme override is what allows you to:**

- customize existing themes:
  - [theme-chocolatine](/docs/3.x/extensions/theme-chocolatine/)
- upgrade Front-Commerce and benefit from the latest component improvements.
- or create a slightly different theme for events like Black Friday with
  confidence!

Having an understanding of
[themes in Magento](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/frontend-core/guide/templates/),
[child themes in Wordpress](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/)
/
[Prestashop](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/themes/reference/template-inheritance/parent-child-feature/),
[templates override in Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/theming-drupal/twig-in-drupal/working-with-twig-templates),
[themes in CakePHP](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/views/themes.html) will help
you understand Front-Commerce’s theme overrides because they all share the same
philosophy. If you have no previous experience with these other implementations,
let’s see how it works!

Your own theme will be located in its own folder and will use default components
from parent theme(s). You would then copy the files you want to override in your
theme folder by maintaining an identical file structure. Your component will
then be used instead of the one in your parent theme(s).

This translates in those three steps:

1. configure your custom theme and use it in your application
2. copy the file (`jsx`, `scss` or `gql`) you want to override in the `theme`
   folder of the `app` directory
3. customize its content in your extension directory

## Creating the `theme` folder

:::info

Whatever method you use, we will refer to this folder as "theme" for the rest of
this documentation

:::

### Using the skeleton as base

First we need to create the `theme` directory in your `app` folder

```
my-project
└── app
    └── theme
```

That’s it! You have successfully created the folder that will be the root of
your custom theme!

### In your own extension

You can also extend theme in your extension, please read
[Register an extension](/docs/3.x/guides/register-an-extension) guide to know
how to create your own extension.

First in your extension definition file, add the `theme` entry:

```javascript title="extension/theme-acme/index.ts"
import path from "path";
import { defineExtension } from "@front-commerce/core";

export default function themeAcme() {
  return defineExtension({
    name: "AcmeTheme",
    // highlight-next-line
    theme: "extensions/theme-acme/theme",
    configuration: {
      providers: [],
    },
  });
}
```

And now theme file will be injected in your project!

## Override a component

Let's add the description of a `Product` to a `ProductItem` as an example of
overriding the base theme.

The original file is:
[`node_modules/@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItem.js`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItem.jsx)

:::info

Please refer to the
[Front-Commerce’s folder structure documentation page](/docs/3.x/concepts/react-components-structure)
to get a better understanding of how components are organized in the base theme.

:::

1. copy it to: `theme/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItem.jsx`
2. add the description after the `<ProductOverview />` component in your
   `ProductItem` with `{props.description}`.

**But you are not done yet!** The `description` information is not included in
the GraphQL fields fetched by the application in the base theme. You will thus
need to update the fragment related to `ProductItem`.

:::info

In this case, the data fetching is made using a GraphQL request. Since our
component use data fetched by a GraphQL request, we need to update this fragment
to add the data we want to the request.

We invite you to read the
[request data flow](/docs/3.x/concepts/a-request-data-flow) to learn more about
how data are fetched in Front-Commerce.

:::

The original fragment file is collocated with the original component at:

1. copy the
   [`original ProductItemFragment`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItemFragment.gql?ref_type=heads)
   to the equivalent location in your extension.
2. add the field `description` to the fragment.

   ```diff title="app/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItemFragment.gql"
   fragment ProductItemFragment on Product {
     imageUrl
   + description
     ...ProductOverviewFragment
     ...ProductItemActionsFragment
   }
   ```

3. restart the application

The data will now be fetched from GraphQL every time the `ProductItem` is used
(product listings, upsells…) and will be available for you to render it as
wanted.

### Reuse the original component

Front-Commerce has been designed with small components having a single
responsibility. **We believe that theme overrides should cover most of your use
cases**. For some features though, it appeared that reusing the base component
could be really useful. For instance, if you want to add a small feature or
wrapper without changing the core feature of a component.

It is possible to import a component from the `@front-commerce/theme/` module
instead of `theme`. It is similar to if you were importing components from other
libraries.

:::note

**Use with care!** We don't think that this method should be the default one,
because it can make your updates more painful.

:::

In the file that we've created in the previous section, instead of copying the
original source file you could set it up like this:

```jsx title="theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItem.jsx"
import BaseProductItem from "@front-commerce/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItem.js";

const ProductItem = (props) => (
  <div>
    {/* Add your feature here */}
    <BaseProductItem {...props} />
  </div>
);

export default ProductItem;
```
