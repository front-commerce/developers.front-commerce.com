Front-Commerce's theme Chocolatine uses a set of CSS variables defined in
`theme/_variables.scss` to ensure a certain consistency in the application's
design. We recommend to reuse these variables as much as possible, and adapting
them to your project's design choices. See
[Customize the styles](/docs/remixed/guides/customize-the-styles) for more
details about adapting your application to your brand.

## Colors

Defined in `theme/components/atoms/Colors/_colors.scss`, color variables are
useful to ensure a consistent design in your app.

### Base colors variables

Those variables are often used to define other meaningful variables, and serve
as a root color definition base for your theme. They are used in a wide variety
of situation in Theme Chocolatine, from text color to backgrounds.

- `--white`, `--black` and `--red`
- `--shade02`, `--shade03`, `--shade04`, `--shade05` and `--shade06`

### Informational colors

These colors are used to provide quick visual feedback to the user as to the
nature of the information shown to them. They are often used anywhere an
interaction has been made.

- `--success`
- `--info`
- `--warning`
- `--invertedWarning`
- `--error`

### "Brand" colors

Brand colors should be the main colors in your theme. They should be a color
that demands attention, and should be part of the colors that are the most
present in your visuals and marketing material.

- `--brandPrimary` is used nearly everywhere in the theme, it is the colors that
  defines the "mood" of your design.
- `--brandSecondary` is mainly used to bring color "accents" throughout the
  theme.

### "Components" colors

These variables are meant to provide the same color base for all components to
use. Currently, those variables are:

- `--backgroundColor`
- `--divider`
- `--fontColor`
- `--fontDisabled`
- `--hoverableColor`
- `--inputBorderColor`
- `--modalBackground`
- `--modalBorderColor`
- `--optionColor`
- `--optionItemBackground`
- `--optionItemColor`

### Front-Commerce color variables

These variable are solely used for components specific to Front-Commerce, such
as the Editorial Toolbox, or the Magic Button. They are not meant to be
overriden. At the time of writing, there is only one such variable,
`frontCommercePrimary`.

## Layout variables

### Breakpoint variables

Defined in `theme/components/atoms/Breakpoints/_breakpoints.scss` those
variables are used for media queries to determine at what point the app should
be rendered for desktop or mobile. Those variables are:

- `--menuBreakpoint` is used to hide desktop-only or mobile-only element
  depending on the viewport width
- `--tabletBreakpoint` is used to determine what the layout should look like
  depending on the viewport width

### Spacing variables

Defined in `theme/_variables.scss`, those variables are used to help keeping a
consistent layout and spacing between component around the whole app. Those
variables are:

- `--boxSizeMargin`
- `--smallContainerWidth`
- `--containerWidth`

properties in your project.
