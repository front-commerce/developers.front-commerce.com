Here is a quick overview of Front-Commerce's folder structure:

```
src/
├── public/
├── config/
├── server/
|   ├── express/
|   └── modules/
└── web/
    └── theme/
    |   ├── components/
    |   |   ├── atoms/
    |   |   ├── molecules/
    |   |   ├── organisms/
    |   |   └── templates/
    |   ├── modules/
    |   └── pages/
    └── service-worker.js
```

## src/public/

The `public` folder is optional. `public` folder will be browesable on all
stores of your site. You can put in it files you want to expose to the public
(e.g. static assets).

P.S. The `public` folder is exposed on the store level. So if you put a file
called `text.txt` inside it you will be able to get `text.txt` from
`/en/text.txt` or `/fr/text.txt` where `/en`, `/fr` are store base URLs.

## src/config/

The config contains all the files that allow you to configure the behavior of
Front-Commerce.

See more details within the
[Reference documentation](/docs/reference/configurations).

## src/server/

The server contains… the server code! There are two parts:

- `express/`: the node server definition that serves the responses to client
  requests. This includes Server Side Rendering, GraphQL endpoint, image proxy,
  session handlers, etc. (see
  [Add custom endpoints to your server](/docs/advanced/server/add-http-endpoint))
- `modules/`: the modules that compose your GraphQL schema. This includes type
  definitions, resolvers, etc. (see
  [Extend the GraphQL Schema](/docs/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema))

## src/web/

the web contains the client part of the application. As a developer that uses
Front-Commerce, only one folder is interesting inside of `src/web/`. It is the
`theme` folder which defines what your site will look like. This folder is
composed of three subfolders:

- `components/`: contains all the code that defines the look & feel of your
  site. It follows the Atomic Design principles. (see
  [Create a UI Component](/docs/essentials/create-a-ui-component))
- `modules/`: contains all your components that are not related to the style of
  your application. (see
  [Create a Business Component](/docs/essentials/create-a-business-component))
- `pages/`: contains all the root components of your application that are mapped
  to a URL. (see [Add a new page](/docs/essentials/add-a-page-client-side))

In order to learn more about it, please refer to
[React components structure](./react-components-structure).

## src/web/service-worker.js

You can override this file to add more functionality to your service worker such
as
[push notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Re-engageable_Notifications_Push).

:::info

This file is not part of the build process (i.e. it would be copied as is). As
such in order to import scripts using the
[importScripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts)
you need to make sure that the path given to `importScripts` is browseable. The
easiest way to do so is to add the files you want to import using
`importScripts` directly inside the [`public` folder](#src-public). You should
then be able to import them by using
`import("/a_store_base_url/path_to_file_to_import")` e.g.
`import("/en/service-worker-push-notifications.js")`. P.S. the
`/a_store_base_url` is needed since the `public` folder is exposed on the store
level. You can use any of your stores' base URLs as all will expose the same
file.
