## Entering and exiting the maintenance mode

The maintenance mode is activated by setting the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_FORCE_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`
in your Front-Commerce project. Once that is done, any request done in your
application will show the maintenance page instead.

:::tip

The skeleton provides an
[maintenance mode demo example extension](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/main/skeleton/example-extensions/maintenance-mode-demo?ref_type=heads)
with three custom routes to show the interactions with the maintenance mode.

## Testing and customizing the maintenance page

The maintenance page can be changed by overriding the
`theme/pages/Error/Maintenance.tsx` file.

In order to facilitate the edition of this page, you can display it in
development mode by
[activating the maintenance mode](/docs/3.x/guides/maintenance-mode/entering-and-exiting-maintenance-mode).

Alternatively you can navigate to the
[`__front-commerce/maintenance`](http://localhost:4000/__front-commerce/maintenance)
route in your application.

## Controlling Access During Maintenance

To bypass the maintenance mode for certain IP addresses you can configure the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZED_IPS` environment variable. Please
note that you can have multiple IPs separated by a comma like:

```shell title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZED_IPS=127.0.0.1,83.65.12.111,2ce8:c427::7156:ad8e
```

:::caution

Please configure **both v4 and v6** IP as much as possible. You can retrieve
your own IP addresses with https://www.whatismyip.com/
