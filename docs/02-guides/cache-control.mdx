`Cache-Control` headers are implemented to improve user experience by
instructing browsers to store parts of the webpage in their internal cache. By
default, Front-Commerce already applies `Cache-Control` headers to several
important routes:

- Products pages
- Categories pages
- Home page
- `/robots.txt`
- `/sitemaps.xml`

## How to use Cache-Control headers in Front-Commerce

In Front-Commerce, adding `Cache-Control` headers to route is done by leveraging
the
[`CacheControl`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/packages/core/services/implementations/CacheControl.ts?ref_type=heads)
service, available from `FrontCommerceApp`.

:::note

To learn more about available services in Front-Commerce, see our
[documentation](/docs/3.x/api-reference/front-commerce-core/services)

In this example, we'll add `Cache-Control` headers on a "Acme" route.

```ts title="app/routes/_main.acme.ts"
import Acme from "theme/pages/Acme";
import type { LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/node";
import { json } from "@front-commerce/remix/node";
import { FrontCommerceApp } from "@front-commerce/remix";
import { AcmeDocument } from "~/graphql/graphql";

export const loader: LoaderFunction = ({ context }) => {
  const app = new FrontCommerceApp(context.frontCommerce);

  // highlight-start
  app.services.CacheControl.setCacheable({
    sMaxAge: 60,
    staleWhileRevalidate: 21600,
  });
  // highlight-end

  const response = await app.graphql.query(AcmeDocument);

  return json({ acme: response.acme });
};

export default function Index() {
  return <Acme />;
}
```

This snippet will inform the browser that the data resulting from requesting
this route can be safely cached for 60 seconds, and that the cached version can
still be served for 6 hours while the data is being fetched again in the
background.
