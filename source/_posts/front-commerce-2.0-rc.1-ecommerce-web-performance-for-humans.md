Front-Commerce `2.0.0-rc.1` has been released today. More performant and with better defaults, this version is what will make your website faster. This is why we bumped the major version.

## 2.0

We've chosen to bump Front-Commerce's version number to 2.0.

We think that a version 1.0 mean that a solution is both stable and ready-to-use by everyone. Front-Commerce was already in this state since the first 1.0 alpha release.

For more than one year we shipped both improvements and new features in a backward compatible way, for projects that were used in production. We had to do both to satisfy our customers. We even added [support for Magento 1 in a beta release!](/blog/2019/11/20/front-commerce-is-compatible-with-magento1/) Every release could in fact be considered as a minor one (1.1, 1.2…) in a semantic versioning way.

Our latest release was focused on performance improvements: new features, optimizations and tools that help developers to build shops that load under [the 3s threshold](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/).

**If 1.0 was a stable version with sufficient features, we decided that the release making Front-Commerce one of the best solution for blazing fast online stores should be tagged 2.0**!

## What's new in this release?

Too many things to fit in a paragraph! Stay tuned for a dedicated blog post next week to dig into the new features that makes Front-Commerce fast.

By then, you can browse our documentation and the [Migration guides since the last 1.0.0-beta.3 release](/docs/appendices/migration-guides.html). As always, partners and customers can read our [full changelog from Front-Commerce release notes](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/releases).

Feel free to send us [an email](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com) or a [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/front-commerce/shared_invite/enQtMzI2OTEyMDYzOTkxLWEzODg2NjM5MmVhNGUwODE0OTI4MWMwYTcxZWZkNzE1YjU4MzRlZmQ0YWY5NDNkZWM0ZGMzMGQ4NDc4OTgxMTU) message if you have any question.

## Ready for takeoff

Check out our [Magento 2 demo store](https://magento2.demo.front-commerce.com/) and the same codebase connected to a [Magento 1 instance](https://magento1.demo.front-commerce.com/). We hope you'll notice how far we went over the past few months. Incredible speed is only a beginning: **Front-Commerce will keep increasing your online store performance from now on.**

For this reason, several teams consider using Front-Commerce as a solution to provide a migration path to their Magento 1 customers: deliver a new frontend experience that increase sales by September, replatform the backend in 2021 or later.

## Accelerating

Over the past few months we've accelerated our growth, created a dedicated company for Front-Commerce and onboarded our CEO: [Laurent Lacaze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurent-lacaze-a404125/).

Being customer-driven, led us to balance our roadmap between refactoring, improvements and new features. We've made performance a priority.

Our team is also committed to make projects built by others successful and **professional services (trainings, expertise…) kept us busy!** We helped partners and customers to upgrade to this version and troubleshoot their performance issues. To date, some are in production since february, others are about to go live but **all stores in production will be using Front-Commerce 2.0+ in the next few months.**

Performance will remain our core-promise, and you can expect continuous improvements over the next releases.
