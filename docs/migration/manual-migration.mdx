parts, or debug issues in the migration CLI output.

## Components

### SEO Components

The `xxxSeo` components (eg: `HomeSeo`) have been removed in favor of
[Remix Meta](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/meta-v2).

If you use SEO components or have overriden Seo components, you need to:

- Remove import and usage of the component from your page
- Use the [meta](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/meta-v2) function with our
  [generateMetas helper](/docs/remixed/api-reference/front-commerce-remix/generate-metas)
  to inject your custom metadatas in your Route Module.

### Refactor pages to Remix routes

Page `Enhancer` HOC usually were responsible for data loading in `2.x`. As we
now embrace
[Remix Server/Client Model](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/pages/philosophy#serverclient-model),
page enhancers must be removed in favor of
[Remix route loaders](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader).

You can see an example in the
[category route file](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/skeleton/app/routes/category.%24id.tsx)
on how the data loading is now used with the `loader` method.

You need to pay attention to two thing if you've overriden this file :

- Did you update the query to fetch category?

We now recommend you to update the GraphQL query used in category route and pass
down any new props to the Category component.

- Did you added more HOC to the `Enhancer`?

You can either add your custom HOC to the `Category` component or replace HOC
with hooks if relevant.

#### `Product` page

In v3, the base theme got completely rid of any HOC, by leveraging on standard
mechanics from Remix loaders and hooks:

- `withTrackPage` and `withProductTracking` responsibilities have been
  transfered to `useTrackPage` and `useProductPage` hooks
- Loading state management is done directly at route loader level

#### `Account` pages

Similarly, page-base HOCs on the Account page have been completely removed, and
replaced with standard Remix and React mechanics. Here's a list of all removed
Enhancers in those pages:

- `EnhanceDownloadableProduct` (see
  [merge request](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2444))
- `EnhanceAddressBook` (see
  [merge request](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2439))
- `EnhanceDashboard` (see
  [merge request](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2441))

#### `withTrackOnMount` HOC depreciation

`withTrackOnMount` has been deprecated in favor of a new hook `useTrackOnMount`.
The new hook has a slightly different signature:

| Old prop             | New prop         | Prop type                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| isResolvedFromProps  | hasResolved      | ~~`function`~~ â†’ `boolean` |
| mapPropsToProperties | createProperties | `function`                 |

`shouldMountEvent`, `shouldUpdateEvent` and `trackEvent` have been left
unchanged.

```jsx
// Before (HOC)
// remove-start
withTrackOnMount({
  event: "Product Viewed",
  isResolvedFromProps: (props) => !props.loading && props.product,
  mapPropsToProperties: (props) => {
    const finalPrice = props.product?.prices?.finalPrice?.priceInclTax?.value;
    return {
      sku: props.product.sku,
      name: props.product.name,
      price: finalPrice?.amount,
      currency: finalPrice?.currency,
    };
  },
});
// remove-end

// After (Hook)
// add-start
useTrackOnMount({
  event: "Product Viewed",
  hasResolved: !props.loading && Boolean(props.product),
  createProperties: () => {
    const finalPrice = props.product?.prices?.finalPrice?.priceInclTax?.value;
    return {
      sku: props.product?.sku,
      name: props.product?.name,
      price: finalPrice?.amount,
      currency: finalPrice?.currency,
    };
  },
});
// add-end
```

#### `withProductTracking` replaced with `useProductTracking`

Similarly, the page-based HOC `withProductTracking` has been completely removed,
in favor of a new `useProductTracking` hook.

If you used this HOC in your code, you will have to replace it by calling
`useProductTracking` in the component the HOC was previously used on.
`useProductTracking` only takes the product as parameter.

#### `withProductAddedPopIn` removed

The HOC `withProductAddedPopIn` has been completely removed, in favor of using a
local `useState` insied the `Product` component.

If you used this HOC in your code, you will have to replace it by using
`useState` in the component the HOC was previously used on:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
// ...

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [productAdded, setProductAdded] = useState(null);

  // ...

  return (
    <div>
      <ProductAddedPopIn product={productAdded} hidePopin={() => setProductAdded(null)} />

      <ProductView
        onProductAdded={(product) => setProductAdded(product)}
        {/* ... */}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### `withCartTracking` replaced with `useCartTracking`

The page-based HOC `withCartTracking` has been completely removed, in favor of a
new `useCartTracking` hook.

If you used this HOC in your code, you will have to replace it by calling
`useCartTracking` in the component the HOC was previously used on.
`useCartTracking` only takes the cart as parameter.

#### `withLogoutMutation` has been removed

The page-based HOC `withLogoutMutation` has been completely removed, and has
been replaced with a `/logout` route.

If you used this HOC in your code, you can remove it and use a link to `/logout`
instead. See `skeleton/app/routes/logout.tsx` and
`theme/pages/Account/Logout/Logout.jsx` for examples.

## `makeCommandDispatcherWithCommandFeedback` API change

[`makeCommandDispatcherWithCommandFeedback` API has changed](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/2cc5515682349ca0f1b1aba922a277db27ad067c?merge_request_iid=2200).
In version 2, the second parameter of `makeCommandDispatcherWithCommandFeedback`
was an optional boolean (default `true`) and if this parameter was evaluated to
a truthy value, the resulting component had the responsibility of displaying the
result of the command with the `InlineAlert` component. In version 3,
`makeCommandDispatcherWithCommandFeedback` now expects an optional React
component to display the result of the command.

To cope with this change, you need to review all components using
`makeCommandDispatcherWithCommandFeedback`:

- if `makeCommandDispatcherWithCommandFeedback` is called with a falsy second
  parameter, you don't have to change anything
- if `makeCommandDispatcherWithCommandFeedback` is called with a truthy second
  parameter or without the second parameter, you have to adapt your code. To
  have exactly the same behavior as before, the new call should look like:
  ```jsx
  makeCommandDispatcherWithCommandFeedback(
    {
      /* commands definition */
    },
    ({ success, message }) => {
      return (
        <InlineAlert appearance={success ? "success" : "error"}>
          {message}
        </InlineAlert>
      );
    }
  );
  ```

## `withEntityNotFound` API change

[`withEntityNotFound` API has changed](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2354).
In version 2, the parameter `NotFoundComponent` was optional (defaulted to
`NotFound` component). This HOC is now deprecated and is now in the
theme-agnostic `@front-commerce/compat` package. If you still want to use
`withEntityNotFound`, you must now provide a `NotFoundComponent` component
parameter.

To cope with this change, you need to review all component using
`withEntityNotFound` to make sure a `NotFoundComponent` parameter is passed to
it. For example, by using the component it was previously defaulted to:

```jsx
import NotFound "theme/modules/PageError/NotFound/NotFound"

/*
  ... your component
*/

export default withEntityNotFound({
    isFound: () => false,
    NotFoundComponent: NotFound,
})(MyComponent);

```

A even better way would be to get rid of `withEntityNotFound`, and instead
handle this mechanism directly withing the related `loader` by throwing a `404`
response there. For more information about this practice, see
[Remix's guide on handling 404s](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/not-found).

## `PartialProductQuery` removal

In version 3, `PartialProductQuery` has been completely removed as it is not
used by the base theme anymore. If it was used in your project, you will have to
replace it with your own query or fragment.

For reference, the query was:

```graphql
#import "theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItemFragment.gql"

query PartialProductQuery($sku: String!) {
  product(sku: $sku) {
    ...ProductItemFragment
  }
}
```

## Sass Migration

In the latest version of Front-Commerce we converted all global Sass variables
to CSS variables during the [automated migration](./automated-migration). This
allows for a more modular approach to theming and a better developer experience.
However, there are still some manual steps that need to be taken to complete the
migration.

### Breakpoints Removal

The following scss helpers have been removed. If you were using them, you have
to manually add them back to your project or update implementation

- [`grid-breakpoints`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/01f9c95003f7d4204acd12264c3375464e6c3a12/theme-chocolatine/web/theme/components/atoms/Breakpoints/_breakpoints.scss#L4-12)
  variable
- [`breakpoint-min`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/01f9c95003f7d4204acd12264c3375464e6c3a12/theme-chocolatine/web/theme/components/atoms/Breakpoints/_breakpoints.scss#L14-21)
  function
- [`media-breakpoint-up`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/01f9c95003f7d4204acd12264c3375464e6c3a12/theme-chocolatine/web/theme/components/atoms/Breakpoints/_breakpoints.scss#L23-34)
  mixin

```mdx-code-block
<details>
  <summary><h4 className="mb-0">To replace usage of these scss methods</h4></summary>
```

Instead of relying on the removed Sass mixins, we recommend to now use a
standardized approach that involves directly using media queries in your CSS
code. This approach provides better control, readability, and maintenance of
responsive styles.

Here are the breakpoints values we used:

- `xs`: 0
- `sm`: 576px
- `md`: 768px
- `lg`: 992px
- `xl`: 1200px

For each breakpoint where you were previously using the `breakpoint-min`
function, replace it with a media query using the `min-width` property. For
example:

**Before:**

```scss
$min: breakpoint-min("sm");
@media (min-width: $min) {
  // Styles for 'sm' and wider
}
```

**After:**

```scss
@media (min-width: 576px) {
  // Styles for 'sm' and wider
}
```

For cases where you were using the `media-breakpoint-up`, you can use a media query with `min-width` too. For example:

**Before:**

```scss
@include media-breakpoint-up("md") {
  // Styles for 'md' and wider
}
```

**After:**

```scss
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  // Styles for 'sm' and wider
}
```

And you can remove `@include media-breakpoint-up("xs") {` as it applied CSS
rules systematically.

```mdx-code-block
</details>
```

```mdx-code-block
<details>
  <summary><h4 className="mb-0">To restore the usage of these scss methods</h4></summary>
```

You can copy it from the v2.x code and add it to a breakpoints override or a
custom file, then you should import it in any of your scss files which require
either the variable, mixin or function, for example:

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Container/Container.scss"
// add-next-line
@import "theme/components/atoms/Breakpoints/breakpoints";

.container {
  background-color: red;

  @media screen and (min-width: $menuBreakpoint) {
    max-width: 40em;
  }

  @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
    background-color: blue;
  }

  @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    background-color: green;
  }

  @include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</details>
```

:::info

After running the codemods on your project, you can find these deprecations by
searching `TODO (Codemod generated)` in your project.

:::

### Media queries

If you use any media queries which use global sass variables, you need to
manually import the file defining the variables.

If you have the following example component, You will need to import the
`breakpoints.scss` file.

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Form/Fieldset/Fieldset.scss"
// add-next-line
@import "theme/components/atoms/Breakpoints/breakpoints";

fieldset {
  border: none;
  font-size: var(--regularSize);
  .fieldset--large {
    max-width: 30em;
    @media screen and (min-width: $menuBreakpoint) {
      max-width: 40em;
    }
  }
}
```

If you're using the `$boxSizeMargin`, `$smallContainerWidth`, or
`$containerWidth` variables you should to import `@import "theme/variables";`
instead.

:::info

After running the codemods on your project, you can easily find these
occurrences by searching `TODO (Codemod generated)` in your project.

:::

### Color functions

If you use any Sass
[color functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color) you will
need to directly import the
[color.scss](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/01f9c95003f7d4204acd12264c3375464e6c3a12/theme-chocolatine/web/theme/components/atoms/Colors/_colors.scss)
file at the location where it is used. This is because Sass can not process the
functions on CSS variables.

If you have the following example component:

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Example/Example.scss"
.Example {
  color: darken(var(--colorPrimary), 10%);
}
```

You would need to import the `color.scss` directly in the `Example.scss` file

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Example/Example.scss"
// add-next-line
@import "theme/components/atoms/Colors/colors";

.Example {
  // remove-next-line
  color: darken(var(--colorPrimary), 10%);
  // add-next-line
  color: darken($colorPrimary, 10%);
}
```

### Calculations

The automated migration step takes care of changing SASS global variables to
[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
and of transforming declarations value with a unique multiplication and
[the usage of `math.div`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/math/#div)
so that it becomes a valid CSS declaration:

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Example/Example.scss"
.example {
  // remove-next-line
  padding: $boxSizeMargin;
  // add-next-line
  padding: var(--boxSizeMagin);

  // remove-next-line
  margin-top: $boxSizeMargin * 2;
  // add-next-line
  margin-top: calc(var(--boxSizeMagin) * 2);

  // remove-next-line
  margin-bottom: math.div($boxSizeMargin, 4);
  // add-next-line
  margin-bottom: calc(var(--boxSizeMargin) / 4);
}
```

However for more complex calculations or for declarations with several values,
only the usage of the SASS variable will be updated. After this step, a manual
fix is needed. When starting Front-Commerce, `sass` is executed and it will
report any invalid expressions. Here is a list of common pattern to fix:

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Example/Example.scss"
.example {
  // remove-start
  padding: var(--boxSizeMargin) * 2 var(--boxSizeMargin) * 4 var(
      --boxSizeMargin
    ) * 2 0;
  // remove-end
  // add-start
  padding: calc(var(--boxSizeMargin) * 2) calc(var(--boxSizeMargin) * 4) calc(
      var(--boxSizeMargin) * 2
    ) 0;
  // add-end

  // remove-next-line
  max-width: calc(#{var(--boxSizeMargin) * 24} + 50ch);
  // add-next-line
  max-width: calc(var(--boxSizeMargin) * 24 + 50ch);

  // remove-next-line
  margin: calc(-var(--boxSizeMargin) / 4) * 3;
  // add-next-line
  margin: calc(-var(--boxSizeMargin) * 3 / 4);

  // remove-next-line
  padding-left: 1.5rem - calc(var(--boxSizeMargin) / 2);
  // add-next-line
  padding-left: calc(1.5rem - calc(var(--boxSizeMargin) / 2));

  // remove-next-line
  padding-right: 1.5rem - calc(var(--boxSizeMargin) / 2);
  // add-next-line
  padding-right: calc(1.5rem - calc(var(--boxSizeMargin) / 2));
}
```

### `@extend` handling

If `@extend` is used with a selector defined in another stylesheet, you need to
manually import that stylesheet. For example, `sass` would fail compiling the
following stylesheet:

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Example/Example.scss"
.example {
  @extend .another-selector;
}
```

This is happening because `.another-selector` is unknown, so the solution is to
import the stylesheet defining it:

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Example/Example.scss"
// add-next-line
@import "theme/some/path/defining/another-selector";

.example {
  @extend .another-selector;
}
```

## Modal Routes

In V2, a modal state parameter facilitated rendering arbitrary routes in a modal
during routing. In Remix, this is non-trivial unless the target route is a child
route. We have introduced a `ModalLink` component to replace the previous
mechanism. It generates a link that displays a component in a modal upon user
click, with the modal state reflected in the URL hash for sharing and consistent
UI presentation across users.

Here is an example of the required changes:

```jsx title="theme/components/organisms/Header/Header.js"
// add-start
import { ModalLink } from "theme/components/organisms/Modal";
import Login from "theme/components/organisms/Login";
// add-end

export function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      // remove-next-line
      <Link to={{ pathname: "/whatever", state: { modal: true } }}>Login</Link>
      // add-start
      <ModalLink to="/login" linkContent="Login">
        <Login />
      </ModalLink>
      // add-end
    </header>
  );
}
```

## Environment variables

### Magento

In V2, Magento1 and Magento2 environment variables were prefixed the same way.
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_*`, in V3, we have split them into
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO1_*` and `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO2_*`.

```diff
- FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_CONSUMER_KEY=token
- FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_CONSUMER_SECRET=token
- FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ACCESS_TOKEN=token
- FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=token

## Magento 1
+ FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO1_CONSUMER_KEY=token
+ FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO1_CONSUMER_SECRET=token
+ FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO1_ACCESS_TOKEN=token
+ FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO1_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=token

## Magento 2
+ FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO2_CONSUMER_KEY=token
+ FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO2_CONSUMER_SECRET=token
+ FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO2_ACCESS_TOKEN=token
+ FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO2_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=token
```

Other optional variables updated:

| 2.x                                    | 3.x - Magento1                          | 3.x - Magento2                          |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ADMIN_PATH`    | `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO1_ADMIN_PATH`    | `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO2_ADMIN_PATH`    |
| `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_TIMEOUT`       | `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO1_TIMEOUT`       | `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO2_TIMEOUT`       |
| `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ADMIN_TIMEOUT` | `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO1_ADMIN_TIMEOUT` | `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO2_ADMIN_TIMEOUT` |
| `FRONT_COMMERCE_XRAY_MAGENTO_VERSION`  | `FRONT_COMMERCE_XRAY_MAGENTO1_VERSION`  | :x: N/A                                 |

## `makeImageProxyRouter` â†’ `createResizedImageResponse`

The `makeImageProxyRouter` function has been removed in favor of the new
`createResizedImageResponse` function. You can read more about the
implementation details in the
[`createResizedImageResponse` documentation](/docs/remixed/api-reference/front-commerce-core/create-resized-image-response).

All images which are located under `public/images/resized/*` should now be moved
to `public/images/*`. This will allow for the
[`/images/resized/*` resource route](https://remix.run/docs/en/2.0.1/guides/resource-routes)
to be reserved for the new `createResizedImageResponse` function.

## Removal of `SmartLayout` component

In v3 we removed the `SmartLayout` component. This component was used to enhance
the `Layout` component with navigationMenu for the header and footer.

The `Layout` component now requires two props `headerNavigationMenu` and
`footerNavigationMenu` to be passed to it.

This is can be retrieved via a loader: _see example in
[`_main.tsx` layout](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/1237955dda56451bf50b507c1cdd0a703ea32795/skeleton/app/routes/_main.tsx)_

```tsx title="app/routes/_main.tsx"
export const loader = async ({ context }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const app = new FrontCommerceApp(context.frontCommerce);
  const headerResponse = await app.graphql.query(HeaderQueryDocument, {
    name: "data",
  });

  const footerResponse = await app.graphql.query(NavigationMenuDocument, {
    name: "categories",
  });

  return json({
    headerNavigationMenu: headerResponse?.navigationMenu || [],
    footerNavigationMenu: footerResponse?.navigationMenu || [],
  });
};
```

## `react-helmet-async` removal

In version 3, `react-helmet-async` has been removed as it does not make sense in
a remix application. If you used this in any custom components or pages, you
will now need to move it the
[`meta` function](https://remix.run/docs/en/2.0.1/route/meta) of the route.

## Client side log handler removal

[The client side log mechanism has been removed from Front-Commerce
3.0](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2594).
For future version, we plan to bring back this feature. In the meantime, if you
are using this feature or you have overridden a component using this feature,
you need to remove it. In version 2.x, the API was imported from
`web/core/logs/logHandler`.

## `@loadable/component` removal

`@loadable/component` is no longer a dependency of Front-Commerce. That means
components that were previously made _loadable_ are now loaded synchronously as
any other component. In terms of usage, in most cases this change should be
transparent. That's not the case if
[you are manually preloading a component with `Component.preload()`](https://loadable-components.com/docs/prefetching/#manually-preload-a-component)
or if you have overridden a file that is doing it. In those case, you have to
remove `.preload()` calls.

In addition, you can still use `@loadable/component` in your custom components
and then you have to make sure `@loadable/component` is a dependency of your
project.

## `CartSeo` removal

In version 3, `CartSeo` has been removed as it is not used by the base theme
anymore. If you overrode this component or one using it, you will need to move
any of the customisation to the `cart` route
[`meta` function](https://remix.run/docs/en/2.0.1/route/meta).

## `EmptyCart` refactor

The component `EmptyCart` has been refactored and its HOC `EnhanceEmptyCart` has
been removed to benefit from data served directly from the `cart` route loader.
It is now rendered directly as a page in `_main.cart.tsx` instead of rendered as
a component in `Cart`. If you have overridden this component in you project, you
will need to ensure the changes are compatible with the new version.

See
[related MR (!2525)](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2525)
for more informations.

## Removed `MenuNavigation` component

The component `MenuNavigation` was only used in the default theme of
Front-Commerce, and was subsequently removed in version 3.0 (see
[related MR](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2524))

## `react-apollo` usage removed from `theme-chocolatine`

In an effort to remove `react-apollo` dependency in theme chocolatine, we
removed all occurences of `graphql()`, `useQuery()` and `useLazyQuery()` calls
in it, and replace them by either direct API calls using remix's `useFetcher`,
or move them to the related route loader when possible. This means a good number
of `Enhancers` have also been reworked, and sometimes removed completely. Here's
the list of the `Enhancers` that have been removed:

- `EnhanceEmptyCart` (see
  [MR](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2525)):
  `EmptyCart` component is now used as a page rendered directly under `/cart`
  route
- `EnhanceCart` (see
  [MR](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2527))
  was moved to the `/cart` route loader
- `withCountries` (see
  [MR](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2520)):
  replaced with `useCountries` hook
- `EnhanceChoosePayment` (see
  [MR](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2528)):
  replaced with `usePaymentMethods` hook
- `EnhanceHeader` (see

you those were overriden in your project, you will have to check what change and
adapt it in your code:

  [MR](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2537))
- `EnhanceAddToCart` (see

## `useDevice()` removal

We removed the `useDevice()` hook in version 3.0. It was unused in the base
theme, and we had no use cases in mind for it.

Device information are still available in the configuration. Access it using
`config.device`. Please contact us if you have a use case we don't support
anymore.
