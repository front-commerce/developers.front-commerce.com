Front-Commerce 2.0 has been released today. It is the result of years of
development for our production proven React

<abbr title="Progressive Web Application">PWA</abbr> storefront compatible with Magento
1 and Magento 2. Let's take a look at Front-Commerce's most popular features.

## Start quickly and iterate

Merchants want better conversion rates on mobile. Front-Commerce is an ally to
achieve this goal in a timely fashion and reduce their

<abbr title="Total Cost of Ownership">TCO</abbr>. It brings the best practices
and technologies so teams can build a great shopping experience in weeks.

Start with our skeleton, configure it to connect to your backend (requires
installing an extension for Magento platforms) and you have a fully-functional
application in minutes. This starter is similar to our
[online demonstrations](https://demo.front-commerce.com/). You can then iterate
from it!

- convince your boss or a potential customer by building a
  <abbr title="Proof of Concept">PoC</abbr> in 1-day: [customize design tokens](/docs/2.x/essentials/adapt-theme-to-your-brand),
  override some key components…
- leverage [theme overrides](/docs/2.x/essentials/extend-the-theme) to share
  components and themes across stores or for seasonal branding
- with GraphQL modules,
  [combine GraphQL services](/docs/2.x/advanced/graphql/remote-schemas) and
  [extend the default schema](/docs/2.x/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema) to
  match your unique business domain
- deploy often (continuously?) your frontend without any impact on your backend

This is how Front-Commerce allows merchants to **go live in weeks, not months**
or years!

## SEO and tracking by default

Front-Commerce
[leverages Server Side Rendering (SSR)](/docs/2.x/advanced/theme/server-side-rendering)
to ensure an optimal crawling by search engines. It supports redirections
(including Magento URL rewrites),
[sitemap generation](/docs/2.x/advanced/production-ready/sitemap) and a base
theme with many schema.org metadata built-in.

Manage many trackings with ease thanks to Front-Commerce's helpers. With
extensive events and page trackings in the base theme, you'll be able to track
everything you want!

## Supporting WYSIWYG and Page builders without sacrificing performance

Build valuable, engaging and well-structured content that combines data from
different sources with ease. It usually is a pain point of most PWA storefronts,
that's why we've improved Front-Commerce over the years.

Front-Commerce 2.0 introduce an overhauled set of features to display WYSIWYG
content in a performant way.

## Caching

Embracing a headless architecture comes with several problems to solve in order
before getting the benefits. Performance, caching and invalidation is one of the
biggest challenge!

Hopefully, Front-Commerce brings 4 years of iterative improvements to the table.
Our GraphQL server advanced helpers and tools to help you keep the performance
we provide in the core.

## Proven payment integrations

Payments are a sensitive part of any eCommerce store. Front-Commerce supports
payment providers out of the box, to ensure that Customers will have a perfect
payment journey.

There are different ways to integrate payments in your Front-Commerce checkout.
It gives you some freedom to work with eCommerce platforms existing payment
modules or going agnostic with
[Front-Commerce Payments](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/front-commerce-payments).
Extensibility is also at the core of payment integrations, so you can customize
how payments are done or implement your own payment provider.

## Platform agnostic

[Magento 1](/docs/2.x/category/magento1) and
[Magento 2](/docs/2.x/category/magento2) stores have been running in production
for years. Our GraphQL server allows you to keep the same frontend and enables
**progressive migrations** use cases.

Front-Commerce support multi-store setups and can even allow merchants to use
different backends for each one of them. Our Prismic and Wordpress integrations
allows merchants to use modern CMS for their content.

We started supporting other platforms, and projects will go live in 2021 using
them. Your feedback is important to us:

## Batteries included

Front-Commerce stores are running in production since 2018. We've refined every
aspect that you'd expect from an application to make operations seamless and
reduce friction with low-level implementation details.

**Spend time on things that matter** and leverage Front-Commerce for the rest.
Here are some of the things you'll don't have to design or maintain:

- [simple yet efficient routing](/docs/2.x/essentials/add-a-page-client-side)
  inspired by the best open-source solutions out there
- [smart predictive prefetching](/docs/2.x/advanced/performance/preloading-routes)
  for a great perceived performance
- [performant and responsive images](/docs/2.x/advanced/production-ready/media-middleware)
  with modern formats
- [unified configurations](/docs/2.x/advanced/server/configurations) with
  modular configuration providers: a better developer experience and unlimited
  advanced patterns
- [develop in Storybook](/docs/2.x/essentials/add-component-to-storybook) with a
  sane set of defaults (including regression testing with Storyshots) to
  customize Front-Commerce's base theme easily and be productive.
- **a friendly human team you can rely on!** We care about your project and act
  as partners of your project. Get support from the makers of Front-Commerce,
  and direct access to the core team for professional services (training,
  audit…) to secure your project and learn from experts.

… oh and also: **we take care of keeping libraries up-to-date** and ensuring
they are compatible together (in a backward-compatible way). Follow
[our migration guides](/docs/2.x/appendices/migration-guides) and keep your
sanity! That was what Front-Commerce 2.0 was about too.

We cannot list everything here but would be glad to answer your questions.
