## Installation

First you need to create a new route under `/routes/graphql.ts`:

Then you can simply re-export the loader and action from the
`@front-commerce/remix` package

```ts title="/app/routes/graphql.ts"
export { loader, action } from "@front-commerce/remix/playground.server";
```

:::caution

The playground is currently only available on the `/graphql` route, if you add
it to any other routes, it will try to redirect to the `/graphql` route.

## Playground in a staging environment

The playground must not be enabled in a production environment. However, it is useful in staging environments. To enable it in a production build you need to set the `FRONT_COMMERCE_ENV` environment
variable to `dev`. The application will start as usual, but you could access the playground to query your live GraphQL server.
