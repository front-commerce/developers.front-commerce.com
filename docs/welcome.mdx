Grasping all the concepts around a product such as Front-Commerce is exciting
but can be intimidating. Therefore, we tried to create and organize this
documentation so that you could quickly find the information you need depending
on your context.

## Welcome to Front-Commerce’s official documentation

Even though Front-Commerce is a proprietary product, we have decided to maintain
our documentation in the open.

**It means that you could understand how the product works and see code samples,
to help you decide whether Front-Commerce is relevant for your project or not.**

It also means that you are encouraged to contribute to the documentation and
help us making it as good as possible. Keep
[Uncle Bob’s famous « Boy Scout Rule »](http://wiki.c2.com/?BoyScoutRule) in
mind… any contributions is welcome (fixing a typo, adding troubleshooting,
opening an issue to suggest new content).

Each page contains a direct « Edit on GitHub » link to allow you to quickly
suggest a change or fix typo/grammar mistakes while reading it.

## First Steps

Grasping all the concepts around a product such as Front-Commerce is exciting,
but can be intimidating. We tried to create and organize this documentation in a
way that you could quickly find the information you need depending on your
context.

This documentation lives in a more global website for developers, so you might
be able to find more information in our [changelog](/changelog) or content
pages.

Whether you want to understand our vision or get an
[architectural overview of Front-Commerce](/docs/concepts/architecture-overview)
as a system and its internals you can start here.

In case you have made your choice and want to start your project, you might be
interested by browsing all the documentation to
[get your project started](/docs/essentials/installation).

If your project is running and you are developing new features, we have some
practical recipes in the "Essentials" part of this documentation to help you
getting things done. The "Reference" section contains different API references
for the important aspects of a Front-Commerce application.

Last but not least, if you are upgrading a project to the latest Front-Commerce
version, we have documented some
[Migration guides](/docs/appendices/migration-guides) to make the process as
seamless as possible.
