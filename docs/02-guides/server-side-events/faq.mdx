## What events are implemented in Front-Commerce?

:::info

Currently, Front-Commerce only implement the OrderPlaced events, but more events
will be added in the future.

:::

| Event         | Description                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `OrderPlaced` | This event is triggered when an order is placed. |

## How can I test Server events in local environment?

To test server events in a local environment, you need a Redis server, and you
must configure redis host and port in your `front-commerce.config.ts` file:

```ts title="front-commerce.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/config";

export default defineConfig({
  extensions: [themeChocolatine()],
  serverEvents: {
    integrations: [],
    // highlight-start
    redis: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 6379,
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
});
```

Then you need to start the worker by running the following command from your
project : `pnpm run worker`

If you would like to obtain additional information and enable debug mode, you
can do one of the following:

- Run the command with the DEBUG flag :
  `DEBUG=front-commerce:server-events:cli pnpm run worker`
- Add the debug flag to your `.env` file :
  `DEBUG=front-commerce:server-events:cli`

## What data is published for a Server Event?

The data returned by the events is an object with the following properties :

```json
{
  event_type: string, // Type of the event defined in the Event emitter
  created_at: string // Timestamp of when the event was created
  payload: object // The data of the event
  metadata: object // The metadata of the event
}
```
