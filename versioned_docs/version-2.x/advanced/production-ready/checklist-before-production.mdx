title: Before going to production
description:
  Before going to production, you should ensure that everything has been
  customized to provide the best possible experience to your users. Some
  features are not critical enough to block your developments and you may have
  forgotten them during the project. This page contains a checklist to help you
  before the go-live!

To ensure that you are good to go, you can go through this checklist :

- [ ] Style your **Offline page**

<div className="pl-6">

:::info

This page is accessible when you disable your network while navigating in your
shop. If you have `FRONT_COMMERCE_ENV !== "production"` this page will also be
available at `/__front-commerce/offline`. You can then edit the
`theme/pages/Offline` component to make sure that this page suits your brand.

:::

</div>

- [ ] Style your **Maintenance page**

<div className="pl-6">

:::info

This page is accessible when your backend returns is in Maintenance mode (503).
If you have `FRONT_COMMERCE_ENV !== "production"` this page will also be
available at `/__front-commerce/maintenance`. You can then edit the
`theme/pages/Maintenance` component to make sure that this page suits your
brand.

:::

</div>

- [ ] Ensure your server can serve the application in **HTTPS** mode.

<div className="pl-6">

:::info

Front-Commerce is aimed at being exposed in HTTPS when in production mode
(`NODE_ENV === "production"`). It will redirect users to an HTTPS url if they
try to access a page using HTTP. Cookies are also set with secure mode. If you
want to overcome this limitation (which we donâ€™t recommend!), you may use the
[`FRONT_COMMERCE_UNSAFE_INSECURE_MODE` environment variable](/docs/reference/environment-variables#host).

:::

</div>

- [ ] Ensure that the `manifest.json` is correct.

<div className="pl-6">

:::info

It provides informations about the application so that the web browser can
detect whether it's a Progressive Web Application. See
[the customize manifest.json guide](/docs/advanced/theme/manifest-json).

:::

</div>

- [ ] Ensure that the `robots.txt` has been overridden.

<div className="pl-6">

:::info

It instructs bots what they can access. By default,
[it forbids crawling to prevent unexpectedly exposing dev applications](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/784684ce56cca69ca5c2e42d5d421a8c0b4bb9c3/public/robots.txt).
