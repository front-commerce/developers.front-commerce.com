title: Extend the GraphQL schema
description:
  When developing an e-commerce store, you might at some point need to expose
  new data in your unified GraphQL schema to support new features and allow
  frontend developers to use them. Front-Commerceâ€™s GraphQL modules  is the
  mechanism allowing to extend and override any part of the schema defined by
  other modules.
---

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

The Front-Commerce core and platform integrations (such as Magento2) are
implemented as GraphQL modules. They leverage features from the GraphQL Schema
Definition Language (<abbr title="Schema Definition Language">SDL</abbr>).

This page will guide you through the process of exposing a new feature in your
GraphQL schema. We will create a GraphQL module that allows to maintain a
counter of clicks for a product.

You will learn to:

1. create a new GraphQL module
2. register the GraphQL module in the Front-Commerce application
3. implement the GraphQL module itself: add a field to the `Product` type and
   add a new `Mutation` to the schema

## Create a new GraphQL module

Letâ€™s say that we want to expose a counter of clicks for each product in our
store. We first have to create a `ClicksCounters` GraphQL module.

This GraphQL module should appear in the folder of a Front-Commerce module. For
instance, if the Front-Commerce module is in `my-module`, the GraphQL module
should be in `my-module/server/modules/clicks-counter`. Learn more about
Front-Commerce modules within
[Extend the theme](/docs/essentials/extend-the-theme).

In the GraphQL module folder, there should be a definition file which will
determine how the module should behave within your Schema:

```js title="my-module/server/modules/clicks-counters/index.js"
export default {
  namespace: "ClicksCounters",
};
```

A GraphQL module has to export an object containing the different services it
provides.

This module is valid even though it does nothing. However, it is not used in
your application yet. You need to register it.

## Register the module in the application

Front-Commerce allows you to manage your modules in the
[`serverModules` key of the `.front-commerce.js` file](/docs/reference/front-commerce-js#servermodules)
located in your projectâ€™s root.

Letâ€™s add a `ClicksCounters` GraphQL module by adding it to the existing list:

```js title="./front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  name: "Front-Commerce",
  url: "https://www.front-commerce.test",
  modules: [
    // highlight-start
    "./my-module",
    // highlight-end
  ],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
    // highlight-start
    {
      name: "ClicksCounters",
      path: "./my-module/server/modules/clicks-counters",
    },
    // highlight-end
  ],
};
```

The `name` key must be unique across your server modules. It is a temporary name
that is used during a code generation step and has no other usage in the
application. _Do not worry about it, it will be deprecated in a near future: see
[#179](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/179)
for further information._

The `path` must be a path to your module definition file (created above).

:::info In depth

under the hood, Front-Commerce is generating a `.front-commerce/modules.js` file
from this configuration which is loaded very early in the server bootstrapping
process. The name is used to import the correct module and export it in an
homogeneous list, used by the `withGraphQLApi` express middleware.

:::

Restart your application.

**Congratulations!** ðŸŽ‰ You now have a new custom module ready to enhance the
data exposed in the GraphQLÂ middleware.

## Implement moduleâ€™s features

All the wiring is now done and it is time to develop the features of this
module. In GraphQL a good practice is to start thinking about the schema, from a
business domain perspective.

It is important to name things with a language shared by the team and prevent
exposing implementation details (ids, different namesâ€¦) as much as possible. We
recommend the reading of the GraphQL documentation page
[Thinking in Graphs](https://graphql.github.io/learn/thinking-in-graphs/).

<!-- TODO Add a link to detailed explanations about ids and Apollo Client cache -->

Letâ€™s add the code to expose a counter field and a mutation in our graph.

### Define the schema

Front-Commerce lets you describe your schema using the expressive
[GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#type-language).

Create a `my-module/server/modules/clicks-counters/schema.gql` file to contain
the schema matching our use case.

We would like to:

1. add a `clicksCounter` field to the existing `Product` type
2. add an `incrementProductCounter` mutation

It could look something like this:

```graphql title="my-module/server/modules/clicks-counters/schema.gql"
extend type Product {
  clicksCounter: Int
}

extend type Mutation {
  incrementProductCounter(sku: String!, incrementValue: Int): MutationSuccess
}
```

:::info

The `Product` type is part of Front-Commerceâ€™s `Magento2` module. <br /> The
`MutationSuccess` type, used as the response for the mutation, is part of
Front-Commerceâ€™s core.

:::

:::note

Please note that it could have been implemented as a top level Query as well:

```graphql
extend type Query {
  clicksCounterByProductSKU(sku: String!): Int
}
```

However, we feel it would have been less intuitive for front-end developers. On
the other hand, it may seem more natural for developers familiar with designing
relational databases or REST APIs. Still, we recommend limiting as much as
possible the number of top-level queries in your projects to learn _thinking in
GraphQL_.

:::

Let's expose the schema using the `typeDefs` key of the module definition. We
recommend to make the dependency to Magentoâ€™s Product module explicit by adding
a `dependencies` key. Update the entrypoint:

```js title="my-module/server/modules/clicks-counters/index.js"
// highlight-start
import typeDefs from "./schema.gql";

// highlight-end
export default {
  namespace: "ClicksCounters"
  // highlight-start
  dependencies: [
    "Magento2/Catalog/Products"
  ],
  typeDefs: typeDefs
  // highlight-end
};
```

:::note

Webpack is taking care of converting SDL into a Javascript object using an
appropriate loader.

:::

**Congratulations again!** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ You should now be able to see these new fields
and use them in GraphQL, **without even having to restart the application!**

Try to execute the query below in your GraphQL playground (by default at
[http://localhost:4000/playground](http://localhost:4000/playground)):

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000/playground"
{
  product(sku: "WH09") {
    sku
    clicksCounter
  }
}
```

Our GraphQLÂ module does not yet have any code for sending content. This means
that even if you can request the `clicksCounter` field, it won't actually return
any data. So you should see the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "product": {
      "sku": "WH09",
      "clicksCounter": null
    }
  }
}
```

Letâ€™s now add some executable logic to our module.

### Implement resolvers

The GraphQL middleware relies on resolver functions to determine the data to
return for a given field. This is where most of the Â« real work Â» is done, for
instance by fetching remote datasources or transforming data.

Resolvers are exposed using the `resolvers` key of the module definition. It
should be a [**Resolver map**](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/resolvers): an
object where each key is a GraphQL type name, and values are mapping between
field names and resolver function. Resolver functions may return a
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)
for asynchronous operations.

:::note

To learn more about resolvers and their internals, we recommend reading
[GraphQL Tools resolvers documentation](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/resolvers).

:::

First, update the module definition as follow:

```js title="my-module/server/modules/clicks-counters/index.js"
import typeDefs from "./schema.gql";
// highlight-next-line
import resolvers from "./resolvers";

export default {
  namespace: "ClicksCounters",
  dependencies: [
    "Magento2/Catalog/Products"
  ],
  typeDefs: typeDefs
  // highlight-next-line
  resolvers: resolvers
};
```

And then create the `resolvers.js` file with a resolver map as below (we are
going to analyze it in details in a few seconds):

```js title="my-module/server/modules/clicks-counters/resolvers.js"
const counters = new Map();

const currentValueOf = (sku) => counters.get(sku) || 0;

export default {
  Product: {
    clicksCounter: ({ sku }) => currentValueOf(sku),
  },

  Mutation: {
    incrementProductCounter(_, { sku, incrementValue = 1 }) {
      counters.set(sku, currentValueOf(sku) + incrementValue);
      return {
        success: true,
      };
    },
  },
};
```

Letâ€™s analyze this code in detail.

#### Returning the counter value for every `Product`

The first part of the export defines a resolver for the `clicksCounter` field of
any `Product` field.

```js
export default {
  Product: {
    clicksCounter: ({ sku }) => currentValueOf(sku),
  },
};
```

It implements data retrieval for the following part of the schema declared
earlier:

```graphql
extend type Product {
  clicksCounter: Int
}
```

The resolver function will use the `sku` key from its parent data and will
return the current counter value from its local state (defaulting to `0` if no
clicks occurred).

It is important to understand that the `sku` is not a parameter provided by
frontend developers in the Query. It comes from data returned by earlier
resolvers that fetched a `Product`, no matter where in the graph (category,
upsells, cartâ€¦).

#### Incrementing the counter for a SKU

The second part of this resolver map is a `incrementProductCounter` mutation.
Mutations in GraphQL are a way to modify server-side data, like `POST` requests
in REST (whereas queries allow to read data, like `GET` requests in REST).

GraphQL modules must declare mutations by extending the top-level GraphQL
`Mutation` type. You can read more about Mutations in the
[GraphQLâ€™s Mutations documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations).

```js
export default {
  Mutation: {
    incrementProductCounter(_, { sku, incrementValue = 1 }) {
      counters.set(sku, currentValueOf(sku) + incrementValue);
      return {
        success: true,
      };
    },
  },
};
```

In this resolver, the first parameter is unused because in a top level resolver
there is no _parent data_. The second parameter contains arguments passed to the
mutation. These arguments are the `(sku: String!, incrementValue: Int)` part of
the schema definition declared earlier:

```graphql
extend type Mutation {
  incrementProductCounter(sku: String!, incrementValue: Int): MutationSuccess
}
```

The resolver will:

1. use the mandatory `sku` argument to fetch the current counter value from its
   local state
2. increment the counter value of the `incrementValue` optional argument. If the
   `incrementValue` argument has not been defined explicitly in the GraphQL
   request, it defaults to `1`.
3. set this new incremented value for the counter
4. finally, return a value matching the `MutationSuccess` Front-Commerce type
   which in this example is always successful (`{ success: true }`).
   <!-- TODO Add a reference page (and link it from here) for the MutationSuccess type -->

:::tip ProTipâ„¢

you can debug the data passed in a resolver using `console.log` to view its
shape in your server console shell output. To do so, a convenient thing to know
is that `console.log` returns a falsy value. Hence, in the resolver above you
could debug the `sku` value by updating the resolver as below:

```diff
-clicksCounter: ({sku}) => currentValueOf(sku),
+clicksCounter: ({sku}) => console.log(sku) || currentValueOf(sku),
```

:::

**Awesome!** Your GraphQL server now has a new feature, letâ€™s use it!

### Query your new graph

Try to execute the previous query again in your GraphQL playground:

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000/playground"
{
  product(sku: "WH09") {
    sku
    clicksCounter
  }
}
```

You should now have a real value returned!

```json
{
  "data": {
    "product": {
      "sku": "WH09",
      "clicksCounter": 0
    }
  }
}
```

You can even increment the counter by sending a Mutation to your server:

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000/playground"
mutation {
  incrementProductCounter(sku: "WH09", incrementValue: 2) {
    success
  }
}
```

If it was successful, the above query must now return `2` in the `clicksCounter`
field.

### Asynchronous resolvers

In the previous example resolvers were synchronous, meaning that they returned a
value that was immediately available. Most of the time, your resolvers will
fetch data from a remote service and return them asynchronously using a
`Promise`.

Returning `Promise` from resolvers is supported out of the box. Here is an
example of turning the previous resolvers to asynchronous ones:

```js title="my-module/server/modules/clicks-counters/resolvers.js"
const counters = new Map();

const currentValueOf = (sku) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const currentValue = counters.get(sku) || 0;
      resolve(currentValue);
    }, Math.random() * 3000);
  });
};

export default {
  Product: {
    clicksCounter: ({ sku }) => currentValueOf(sku),
  },

  Mutation: {
    incrementProductCounter(_, { sku, incrementValue = 1 }) {
      return currentValueOf(sku)
        .then((currentValue) =>
          counters.set(sku, currentValue + incrementValue)
        )
        .then(() => ({
          success: true,
        }));
    },
  },
};
```

## Make it scale!

Over time your resolvers may grow and contain more business logic. See
[Slim down resolvers with loaders](/docs/advanced/graphql/slim-down-resolvers-with-loaders)
to learn how you could extract logic from your resolvers and keep them easy to
understand.
