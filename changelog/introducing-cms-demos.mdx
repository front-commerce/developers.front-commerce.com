One of the strength of Front-Commerce is that it is platform agnostic: you can
virtually connect to any service and display its data directly on your shop's
front-end.

  But if you are not used to these notions, it might be unclear what does this
  means. This is why we've added two new demos focused on{" "}
  <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> solutions:
  [WordPress](https://wordpress.demo.front-commerce.com) and
  [Prismic](https://prismic.demo.front-commerce.com).

## What's a CMS and why should I care?

A <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> is a tool that focuses on
managing your contents. It can bring you features like advanced content edition,
publishing and reviews tools, version managements, etc. But at the very least,
it is usually better than your e-commerce back office.

This is because an e-commerce solution focuses on what brings you value:
managing orders. Some don't even have tools to edit contents like. And the ones
that have some are either not that great or expensive (ex: Magento's Page
Builder is only available on the Commerce version).

Using a dedicated <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> seems to be
an interesting alternative. But previously it usually meant that you had to have
two websites:

- the users could feel lost and not really know where to find the correct
  information
- the developers will have to maintain two separate front-ends and recreate the
  same features on both websites
- the search engines will favor your CMS contents' rather than your shop

## Headless CMS can be a solution

But you can have the best of both worlds:

- a nice CMS that will make your publishers happy
- only one website that will group your contents and your shop

This is where Front-Commerce comes in. Thanks to its GraphQL middleware, you can
decide to retrieve part of the graph from your CMS's API rather than from your
shop's API.

By doing this, your users will only have one website but will be able to see
pages that have contents that come from both your shop and your CMS. For
instance, you can imagine
[blog posts featuring products](https://wordpress.demo.front-commerce.com/blog/post-with-a-product-card)
or
[home pages with complex contents easily administrable](https://prismic.demo.front-commerce.com/).
Possibilities are endless.

But the best part is that you don't _have to_ start with the correct
architecture or services right from the start. You can first deploy a shop that
uses
[Magento's CMS](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/cms/page-add.html)
pages for instance, and then move your contents to a dedicated CMS when you
need. You won't have to change your theme, but only import the correct GraphQL
module in your Front-Commerce application.

This is all possible thanks to Front-Commerce's architecture.

## How does that work technically?

Behind the scene, we have implemented a Front-Commerce module for each CMS. On
each of these modules we've got two parts.

### [A GraphQL module](/docs/2.x/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema)

It replaces the CMS Pages resolvers to fetch the pages from the new CMS instead
of Magento. This is possible by creating a GraphQL module that only defines
loaders. These will override Magento's module loaders and will then fetch the
data from the CMS's API.

It also adds its own schema to add features specific to the CMS (example: blog
queries). In the case of Prismic we are even using Schema Stitching in order to
be able to query Prismic's GraphQL directly from Front-Commerce's GraphQL. This
makes the integration work as minimal as possible and lets you build new
features quickly while still making them configurable in an admin panel.

### [A theme extension](/docs/2.x/essentials/extend-the-theme)

First of all, it does not need any changes regarding the CMS pages because the
only thing a theme cares about is the GraphQL schema. If it didn't change, there
is no reason to change the theme. And this is why fetching some parts of your
graph to dedicated services can be done during the life of your project and does
not need to wait for a big migration or rewrite.

The new features however are developped by fetching the new data and adding
[the pages](/docs/2.x/essentials/add-a-page-client-side) and
[components](/docs/2.x/essentials/create-a-business-component) depending on the
new schema provided by the GraphQL module. However, this is not a full rewrite.
Any component that already existed in Front-Commerce can be reused (simple ones
like links, buttons, etc. and complex ones like ProductItems, MiniCart, etc.).

This also means that if you want to add the features we've developed in these
demos in your Front-Commerce shops, you could do it by simply adding the modules
to your [`.front-commerce.js`](/docs/2.x/reference/front-commerce-js). A one
line change that brings a complete blog to your shop.
