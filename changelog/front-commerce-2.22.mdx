## Adyen payment now supports Google and Apple Pay

We have added support for Google Pay and Apple Pay to our
[Adyen integrations](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/adyen), making it easier for
customers to make purchases on our platform.

Those were the last 2 payment methods we didnâ€™t support. Weâ€™ve updated our
documentation to
[list the main payment providers supported and tested](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/adyen#payment-methods-support),
and are confident that any Adyen payment method is now supported by
Front-Commerce.

## Attraqt Experience Orchestrator

Merchants can now analyze their recommendation strategies right from their
website with Attraqt's Experience Orchestrator (XO) extension.

By using
[primitives included in our Attraqt module](/docs/2.x/magento2/search-engine#using-attraqt-orchestrator-chrome-extension),
developers can ensure that the application matches the requirements for exposing
the merchandizing rules and algorithms. This extension, improves the experience
for common tasks such as updating a recommendation strategy or troubleshooting
parameters to Attraqtâ€™s API.

## Weâ€™ve continued working on somethingâ€¦[](https://developers.front-commerce.com/changelog/front-commerce-2.21#weve-been-working-on-something)

As
[teased in our previous changelog entry](/changelog/front-commerce-2.21#weve-been-working-on-something),
weâ€™ve been busy working on something new. In 2023, Front-Commerce aims at
providing a top-level DX.

Future releases will contain several improvements that developers have been
asking for, for months! Be prepared for whatâ€™s next. Here is another screenshot
containing some more clues ðŸ•µ (Work In Progress). Stay tuned for more details
over the next **weeks**!
