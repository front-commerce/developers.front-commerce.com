The Tracking API is exposed once the analytics library is initialized with
configuration.

## `trackEvent`

An event is something that happens in your application. For instance, it can
happens when a user clicks on a button, opens a dropdown, etc. It usually
conveys meaning to your marketing team to better understand what drives your
users.

Most of the e-commerce related events are already implemented within
Front-Commerce. But each website will have different behaviors, and it can be
interesting to add your own events to see how your customers uses your
application.

To do so, you will need to call the method `trackEvent` from
`web/core/analytics`.

For instance, let's say that you are building a grocery store and that you have
created Recipe pages that display a list of ingredients needed for the current
recipe. Below this list, you have created a button that adds all the ingredients
to the cart of the user, and you want to know if this button is useful and if
users click on it.

To add your tracking, you would need to call the `trackEvent` method when the
user clicks on the Button. Thus, your new component would look like this:

```js
import React from "react";
import Button from "theme/components/atoms/Button";
// highlight-next-line
import { trackEvent } from "web/core/analytics";

const AddIngredientsToCart = ({ addToCart, ingredients }) => {
  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() => {
        // highlight-start
        trackEvent("Added ingredients to cart", {
          ingredients: ingredients,
        });
        // highlight-end
        addToCart();
      }}
    >
      Add ingredients
    </Button>
  );
};

export default AddIngredientsToCart;
```

This `trackEvent` method is actually a shortcut that lets you call the
`analytics.track` method from the
[`analytics`](https://getanalytics.io/api/#analyticstrack) module. It uses the
exact same API. See
[the official documentation](https://segment.com/docs/spec/track/) for more
detailed information.

Additionally, you may wonder what name and properties you should give to your
events. It depends on the integrations you are using and if you want to create a
new event or use Semantic ones (supported events within Segment.io). To learn
more about this, please refer to the
[Semantic Events documentation](https://segment.com/docs/spec/semantic/).

## `withTrackOnMount`

If you don't have an actual callback to put the `trackEvent` (like `onClick`),
you can use the `withTrackOnMount` enhancer that will let you call the
`trackEvent` using
[React lifecycle](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/).

For instance, in Front-Commerce's core, we are using `withTrackOnMount` to track
when a user sees their cart.

```jsx
import withTrackOnMount from "theme/modules/Analytics/withTrackOnMount";

export default withTrackOnMount({
  event: "Cart Viewed",
  isResolvedFromProps: (props) => !props.loading && props.cart,
  shouldUpdateEvent: (prevProps, nextProps) =>
    prevProps.cart.id !== nextProps.cart.id,
  mapPropsToProperties: (props) => {
    return {
      cart_id: props.cart.id,
      products: props.cart.items.map((item, index) => ({
        sku: item.sku,
        name: item.name,
        quantity: item.qty,
        price: item.priceInfo.price.priceInclTax.value.amount,
        position: index + 1,
      })),
    };
  },
})(Cart);
```

:::note

Please refer to
[Analytics React Components](/docs/reference/analytics-components#withtrackonmount)
to have a detailed explanation of the API of `withTrackOnMount`.

Note that if you prefer to use render props you can refer to
[`TrackOnMount`](/docs/reference/analytics-components#trackonmount).

## `withTrackPage`

In tracking scripts, there is often a distinction between the `page` and the
`event` even though a `page` event is only a subset of the `events`.

To make this distinction clear, we provide an enhancer in the same spirit of
`withTrackOnMount` but for page events: `withTrackPage`.

`withTrackPage` is an enhancer that lets you track a page each time a component
is rendered and when the location has changed.

For instance, in Front-Commerce's core

```jsx
import withTrackPage from "theme/modules/Analytics/withTrackPage";

withTrackPage("Home")(Cart);
```

:::note

Please refer to
[Analytics React Components](/docs/reference/analytics-components#withtrackpage)
to have a detailed explanation of the API of `withTrackPage`.

Note that if you prefer to use render props you can refer to
[`TrackPage`](/docs/reference/analytics-components#trackpage).

Moreover, we didn't talk about a `trackPage` method here. This is because a
`Page` is tightly coupled to a React Component. This is why you shouldn't need
to use `trackPage` directly.
