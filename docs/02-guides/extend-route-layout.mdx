## What is a layout route?

Layout routes are used to apply a the same layout to multiple pages, generally
these are pathless routes. For more information how routing works in Remix,
please see the
[Nested Routes](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/routes#nested-routes)
documentation.

In Front-Commerce some of the main layout routes are:

- [`_main.tsx`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/packages/theme-chocolatine/routes/_main.tsx)
- [`_main.user.tsx`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/packages/theme-chocolatine/routes/_main.user.tsx)
- [`_main.user.orders.tsx`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/packages/theme-chocolatine/routes/_main.user.orders.tsx)
- [`checkout.tsx`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/packages/theme-chocolatine/routes/checkout.tsx)

To extend these routes you can either create your own layout route or re-use an
existing one.

## Create a new layout route

To create a new layout route you can create a new file in the `routes` folder

```tsx title="routes/_main.tsx"
import { Outlet } from "@remix-run/react";

const Layout = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>{...}</header>
      <div className="content">
        <Outlet />
      </div>
      <footer>{...}</footer>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Layout;
```

:::warning

This will override the existing `_main.tsx` layout in the original theme, it
doing so it might also override required actions, loaders, meta, etc. Please
refer to the original layout to ensure you are not missing anything. If you you
simply require a new layout, you can name it differently, for example
`_layout.tsx`. or re-use the existing layout route, see
[below](#re-use-an-existing-layout-route).

:::

## Re-use an existing layout route

To re-use an existing layout route you can create a new file in the `routes`

```tsx title="routes/_main.tsx"
export * from "theme/UNSTABLE_routes/_main"; // ensures all actions, loaders, meta, etc. are preserved
export { default } from "theme/UNSTABLE_routes/_main"; // ensures the component is preserved
```

Using this method you can also extend an existing layout route, for example

```tsx title="routes/_main.tsx"
export * from "theme/UNSTABLE_routes/_main";
import MainLayout from "theme/UNSTABLE_routes/_main";

const ExtendedMainLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <MainLayout />
      <div>My custom content</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In the above example the `<MainLayout>` already contains an `<Outlet>` so you do
not need to add it a second time.

:::caution

As indicated by the `UNSTABLE_` prefix, this is an unstable API and may change.
