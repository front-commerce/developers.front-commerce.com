import ContactLink from "@site/src/components/ContactLink";

You can configure search and product lists with filters using the following
platforms:

- [Native search](#native-search)
- [Elasticsearch](#elasticsearch)
  - [Requirements](#requirements)
  - [Front-Commerce configuration](#front-commerce-configuration)
- [Algolia](#algolia)
  - [Requirements](#requirements-1)
  - [Front-Commerce configuration](#front-commerce-configuration-1)

## Native search

Front-Commerce supports searching using the native Magento API for category
listing pages. Please <ContactLink /> if your store uses a custom Magento search
implementation to see how to make it work in your Front-Commerce project.

## Elasticsearch

### Requirements

On Magento's side, you need to install
[the `front-commerce-oss/magento1-elasticsuite-indexer` module](https://github.com/front-commerce/magento1-elasticsuite-indexer#magento-1-elasticsearch-indexer-).
You can install it with composer:

```shell
composer require front-commerce-oss/magento1-elasticsuite-indexer
```

After the installation, you need to configure it, at least:

1. in System > Catalog > Catalog in the _Catalog Search_ section, make sure the
   search engine is set on _Smile Searchandising Suite_
1. in the same section, set the server host and port
1. take note of the alias (`magento` by default)

You can then run the indexer so that the products, categories and cms pages are
indexed in Elasticsearch.

### Front-Commerce configuration

First, you need to make sure the Elasticsearch search client is installed with a
version that matches your ElasticSearch server:

```shell
npm i @elastic/elasticsearch@6
```

On Front-Commerce side, you need to enable the Elasticsearch datasource by
making the changes in your `.front-commerce.js` file similar to:

```diff title='.front-commerce.js'
-  modules: [],
+  modules: ["./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/datasource-elasticsearch"],
   serverModules: [
     { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
+    {
+      name: "Magento1Elasticsearch",
+      path: "datasource-elasticsearch/server/modules/magento1-elasticsearch",
+    },
     { name: "Magento1", path: "server/modules/magento1" },
   ]
```

:::caution Known issue

Tthe Elasticsearch server module needs to be enabled **before** the Magento's
module.

:::

Then, in your `.env` file, you need to define
[the `FRONT_COMMERCE_ES_HOST` and `FRONT_COMMERCE_ES_ALIAS` variables](/docs/2.x/reference/environment-variables#elasticsearch).

After restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able run a GraphQL query to
search for products, for instance:

```graphql
query Search {
  search(query: "whatever you want to search for") {
    query
    products(params: { from: 0, size: 5 }) {
      total
      products {
        sku
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you are using the default theme or the theme Chocolatine, the search bar
should now be visible.

## Algolia

### Requirements

On Magento's side, you need to install
[the `algolia/algoliasearch-magento` module](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-magento).
You can install it with modman:

```shell
modman clone https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-magento.git
```

After the installation, you need to configure it, at least:

1. in System > Algolia Search > Configuration in the _Credentials & Setup_
   section, set the _Enable Indexing_ option
1. in the same section, fill the credentials you can find on
   [the Algolia Dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard/api-keys)
1. The attribute `category_ids` must be listed in both the facets configuration
   and in the indexed product attributes (and there it must be set as
   _Searchable_) as Front-Commerce relies on it to list the products in
   categories.

You can then run the indexer so that the products are indexed in Algolia's
index.

:::note

`category_ids` is the only required facets. Depending on your project, you can
configure any other attribute to be exposed as a facet by following the same
steps.

:::

### Front-Commerce configuration

First, you need to make sure the Algolia's search client is installed:

```shell
npm i algoliasearch
```

On Front-Commerce side, you need to enable the Algolia datasource by making the
changes in your `.front-commerce.js` file similar to:

```diff title=".front-commerce.js"
-  modules: [],
+  modules: ["./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/datasource-algolia"],
   serverModules: [
     { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
+    {
+      name: "Magento1Algolia",
+      path: "datasource-algolia/server/modules/magento1-algolia",
+    },
     { name: "Magento1", path: "server/modules/magento1" },
   ]
```

:::caution Known issue

The Algolia server module needs to be enabled **before** the Magento's module.

:::

As of Front-Commerce 2.6, Algolia's module is automatically configured. If you
are using Front-Commerce 2.5, you need to define
[all the Algolia related environment variables](/docs/2.x/reference/environment-variables#algolia)
in your `.env` file.

Front-Commerce 2.6 takes the following parameters from Magento:

- [the Application ID](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/how-to/importing-with-the-api/#application-id)
- [the search only API key](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/#search-only-api-key)
- the index name prefix
- the number of values per facet
- the configured facet attributes

On the configured facets, only the attribute name is taken into account (Facet
type, Label, Searchable and Create Query rule are ignored for now).

:::caution

For performance reason, the configuration retrieved from Magento is cached. As a
result, after changing a parameter in the backoffice, the new parameter will be
taken into account after at most one minute by Front-Commerce.

:::

After restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able to run a GraphQL query to
search for products, categories or pages, for instance:

```graphql
query Search {
  search(query: "whatever you want to search for") {
    query
    products(params: { from: 0, size: 5 }) {
      total
      products {
        sku
        name
      }
    }
    categories(size: 5) {
      name
    }
    pages(size: 5) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

:::info

Support for category or page search with Algolia has been added in
Front-Commerce 2.13.

:::

If you are using the default theme or the Chocolatine theme, the search bar
should now be visible.
