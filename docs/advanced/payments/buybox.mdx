There is only one way to accept payments with [BuyBox](https://www.buybox.net/)
in your Front-Commerce application for now.

## Front-Commerce Payment

<SinceVersion tag="2.3.0" />

This section explains how to configure and customize the BuyBox Front-Commerce
Payment module into an existing Front-Commerce application. The implementation
use BuyBox's API to initiate payments and redirect customers to BuyBox to
proceed to the payment using their Gift Card.

### Configure your environment

With API keys found
[on your BuyBox dashboard (sandbox)](https://sandbox.buybox.net/wallet_backoffice/core/infos.php).

```shell title=".env"
# BuyBox payment
# API Keys from https://sandbox.buybox.net/wallet_backoffice/core/infos.php
FRONT_COMMERCE_BUYBOX_IS_PRODUCTION_MODE=false
FRONT_COMMERCE_BUYBOX_USER=xxxx
FRONT_COMMERCE_BUYBOX_PWD=xxxxxxxxx
FRONT_COMMERCE_BUYBOX_SIGNATURE=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Register the BuyBox payment module

In your Front-Commerce application:

#### Magento2

```diff title=".front-commerce.js"
-   modules: [],
+   modules: ["./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/payment-buybox"],
   serverModules: [
     { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
-    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" }
+    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
+    { name: "BuyBox", path: "payment-buybox/server/modules/payment-buybox" }
   ]
```

#### Magento1 (OpenMage LTS)

BuyBox is not yet supported for Magento 1. Please <ContactLink /> if you need
this integration.

### That's it!

Restart your application and test your payments.

:::tip

You can use the `front-commerce:payment:buybox` flag to `DEBUG` this integration
and view the interactions with the payment API.
