## Allow your customers to return their products with RMA for Adobe Commerce, use advanced caching mechanisms for BigCommerce and facilitate your customers' next payments with Adyen!

Aaah summer times! Sun, _farniente_ and the end of monolithic architectures!
What could be better than a nice release note to brighten up your holiday
reading?

Here goes Front-Commerce 2.17 and our summer release, with many highlights:

- We have progressively migrated our existing live websites to our cloud
  infrastructure, to allow you to benefit from auto-scaling (environments will
  automatically add resources to hold the load), better reliability and better
  monitoring and support
- We have continued to enhance our BigCommerce connector with advanced caching
  mechanisms and new features (we presented the connector for our 2.16 release
  in a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC8ltqSIZVs))
- We added new features for Adyen (register my credit card with Adyen) and
  Magento2 Adobe Commerce (RMA)
- Finally, as always, we have made various patches and adjustments to allow you
  to have an even more efficient front-end 🚀

Have a great summer, see you in September to chop heads! And as always, should
you have any requests regarding the product roadmap, do not hesitate to contact
Josquin 👋

### Our developers doc is getting a new look!

As you may have noticed, our developers doc has changed 💅

Many of you have asked us to review the way our documentation works and we have
followed your advice!

We hope you like this new version, don't hesitate to give us your feedback, it’s
always very useful _(my favourite feature, the light / dark mode switch in the
top right corner 😍)_

The main sections:

- **Docs:** everything you need to play with Front-Commerce
- **Changelogs:** all Front-Commerce product & tech news
- **Support:** if you need help or have a question

### BigCommerce: caching for more performance

Cache management is one of Front-Commerce’s most powerful assets! Every time we
work on a new connector, we need to take into account the way cache mechanisms
work within the integrated solution. Thus we can deal with it to manage caching
as smoothly as possible and help your website go even faster. BigCommerce is no
exception and with this first work on caching, every essential item such as
products, categories, lists, and variants ... will benefit!

### BigCommerce: registration via email

For this 2.17.0 release, we have also enhanced our BigCommerce connector: you
can now create a BigCommerce account from Front-Commerce (the first version of
the connector only supported login for an existing account)

We will accelerate the development of features for BigCommerce in our next
releases, stay tuned! In the meantime, here is a short demo of this new feature:

### RMA for Adobe Commerce: improve user journey by returning items

In a user's online buying experience, it is very powerful to offer an easy
returns process that allows customers and the customer service to communicate
easily.

This is the principle of RMA (Return Merchandising Authorisation): the customer,
after having received his products, can make a total or partial return request
by indicating the reasons for the request and, depending on the acceptance or
refusal of the customer service, send back to the merchant one or more products.

Thanks to the implementation of this new functionality, your Magento2 Adobe
Commerce instances will be able to deliver it within Front-Commerce!

### Adyen for Front-Commerce: save your credit card details

When you make your first online payment, it can be useful to save your payment
details for a future order.

This is now possible in Adyen for Front-Commerce thanks to the integration of
this new feature! Want to see more? Here is the demo:
