## Manual Migration

### Shipping methods

In this release, we reworked the way additional data component can be retrieved
during the shipping method selection at checkout time.

In v2, these component were registered by overriding the
`theme/modules/Checkout/ShippingMethod/AdditionalShippingInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js`
file.

In v3, we're now leveraging on the
[feature registration hook](/docs/3.x/api-reference/front-commerce-core/extension-features#registerfeature)
so that any extension can register its own component without having to override
theme files, which greatly enhance maintainability.

Although this change is backward compatible, we recommend that you update your
`getAdditionalDataComponent` file to take advantage of the latest way of using
additional data components.
