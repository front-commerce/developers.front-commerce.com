import SinceVersion from "@site/src/components/SinceVersion";

<SinceVersion tag="2.11" />

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

Here is the list of currently supported features:

- Display details of the Company a customer belongs to
- Company users handling (list, create, modify and deactivate company users)
- [_Payment on account_](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/payment-on-account) payment
  method
- Display company credit history
- Requisition list
- Negotiable quotes (_require Adobe Commerce 2.4.5+_)

:::info

Those features are only available with
[Adobe Commerce and its B2B module](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/getting-started.html#b2b-features)
and requires at least Adobe Commerce 2.4.3.

## Enable B2B support

### Requirements

On Magento2 side, you need to
[install the Front-Commerce Magento2 Commerce module](/docs/2.x/magento2/commerce#magento2-commerce-module-installation).

You must then install the
[`front-commerce/magento2-b2b-module-front-commerce`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento2-b2b-module-front-commerce)
module:

```shell
composer config repositories.front-commerce-magento2-b2b git \
    git@gitlab.blackswift.cloud:front-commerce/magento2-b2b-module-front-commerce.git
composer require front-commerce/magento2-b2b-module

bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

### Front-Commerce configuration

To leverage those features, you need to enable and integrate the Magento2 B2B
module. Here is how to do it:

1. You need to enable the module in your `.front-commerce.js`:

   ```diff title=".front-commerce.js"
   diff --git a/.front-commerce.js b/.front-commerce.js
   index d607e0c..93ae34d 100644

   +    {
   +      name: "FrontCommerceB2B",
   +      path: "front-commerce/modules/front-commerce-b2b/web",
   +    },
   +
     { name: "Skeleton", path: "./src/web" },
   ],
   };
   ```

1. The web module provides a SCSS file that needs to be imported. To do that,
   you can create an override of `main.scss` containing the following code:

   ```scss title="src/web/theme/main.scss"
   @import "~front-commerce/theme-chocolatine/web/theme/main";
   /*
   if you use the default theme as a base theme, you should use:
   @import "~front-commerce/src/web/theme/main.scss";
   */
   @import "~theme/b2b";
   ```

And that's it. After having restarted Front-Commerce, the B2B module should be
enabled and integrated into your project. If you login as a company user and
then go to the user account dashboard, you should see new B2B specific menu
entries (company management, credit history…).

To enable _Payment on account_ payment method, please refer to
[the Payment on account guide](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/payment-on-account).

## Negotiable quotes

<SinceVersion tag="2.23" />

In order to use Front-Commerce's Negotiable quotes module, you will need to
enable the feature in your Magento back office. Please note that you'll need an
Adobe Commerce B2B version >= 2.4.5.

Navigate to `Stores > Configuration > General > B2B Features`, and set both
`Enable Company` and `Enable B2B quote` to `Yes`.

Quotes also have to be enabled _per-company_. To do so, navigate to a company's
settings (`Customers > Companies`, then open a company), and under
`Advanced settings` switch `Allow Quotes` on.

:::info

Negotiable quotes are only availble to users that have a Company with Quotes
enabled. More in
[Adobe documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/b2b/quotes/configure-quotes.html).

:::

That's it, you should now be able to use Adobe Commerce's Negotiable quotes with
Front-Commerce!

### Known issues

This module has been fully implemented with Adobe Commerce's GraphQL API
(version 2.4.5). Unfortunately, this means it is also limited to what the API
exposes, thus some of the features available in Adobe Commerce's native frontend
could not be tackled yet:

#### Negotiable quotes miminum price is not enforced nor exposed in the GraphQL API

Front-Commerce's module allow the creation of negotiable quotes from _any
amount_, regardless of the settings in Magento.

#### Negotiable quotes GraphQL API does not support file-related features

File upload and download in negotiable quote comments are not available in
Front-Commerce.

#### "Catalog" total prices is not exposed in negotiable quotes

The GraphQL API only exposes the quote's total price with applied discounts from
the sales representative, so the catalog prices cannot be easily displayed.

#### Magento does not expose quote owners' user ID

For this reason, Front-Commerce compares first and last names of a user to
detect ownership. Please note it could lead to subtle edge cases for homonyms in
the same company, where a non-owner could see additional UI components without
being able to act on them.

#### Front-Commerce does not take into account per-company feature deactivation

We do support the global B2B feature toggle and honor user permissions attached to company roles.
However, Front-Commerce doesn't support the per-company feature deactivation.

The reason is because the information isn't exposed in Magento's API, and company ACLs don't change depending on this option.

As a consequence, it is possible that some users belonging to a company with negotiable quote deactivated (on a shop with the feature globally active) will view some negotiable quotes UI.
