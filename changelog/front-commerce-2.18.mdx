## 2.18: Improvements and fixes on our payment modules (Adyen, Lyra, PayPal), Prismic: 1.0.0 and major change, end of our migration from [Platform.sh](http://Platform.sh) to Front-Commerce Cloud, based on GCP

It is back to school time! After a very (very) hot summer, during which we all
enjoyed a well-deserved break, the Front-Commerce team is back and raring to go
üí™

We are pleased to welcome
[Alice](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-malby-343383132/) to the team, who
joins Rachael's marketing team as Lead Generation Manager. Welcome Alice!

Concerning the 2.18.0 release, it will certainly appear less packed than usual,
because of the holiday in August and because we made progress on projects that
we will reveal publicly a little later üçø

So here is Front-Commerce 2.18:

- We have made improvements to our payment modules (PayPal, Lyra, Adyen)
- We made the official 1.0.0 tag of our Prismic module and modified the way we
  manage it, see below for details
- We have made progress on our connector with the search and merchandising
  solution [Attraqt](https://attraqt.com/), which will be released in a beta
  version in the coming weeks, stay tuned!
- We added the reset my password feature to our BigCommerce connector: every
  essential e-commerce feature is now available for this connector!
- Our cloud offer is gradually being strengthened with the implementation of an
  interface to manage your instances! All our sites are now switched to our
  cloud offer üéâ

We wish you all the best for Q4! As for us, we're all set üòé

As always, should you have any requests regarding the product roadmap, do not
hesitate to contact us üëã

### ‚ùïPrismic: tag of the 1.0.0 of the module and major change starting from 2.18

Starting from Front-Commerce 2.18.0, we will change the way we work with our
Prismic connector.

Until now, the Prismic connector was delivered in a dedicated module with its
own release cadence and versioning. We did this to be able to deliver
improvements and new features faster to our early adopters.

Now that several customers have proven the robustness of the module and its APIs
for integrators, we consider it as stable and tagged a final version 1.0.0 for
the module.

As of 2.18.0, this module is now in the Front-Commerce core. New features and
improvements will follow
[our usual release cadence](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/appendices/release-process)
and predictability for integrators and merchants.

### About Front-Commerce Cloud

In August we migrated every front-end hosted by Front-Commerce to our new
infrastructure, Front-Commerce Cloud. They are all now up and running üòé

This allows merchants to benefit from auto-scaling (environments automatically
add resources to handle the load), better reliability, and better monitoring and
support!

And in regards to our support offer, we are working on a nice interface so that
you will be able to monitor your infrastructures, deal with environment
variables and quickly access our support team: more to come (very) soon üëÄ

### Improvements in our payment modules

With the release of Magento 2.4.4, we had to adapt parts of our modules to
ensure compatibility: that was the case for
[our Adyen connector](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/advanced/payments/adyen)

For our
[PayPal](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/advanced/payments/paypal)
and our
[Lyra](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/advanced/payments/payzen)
integrations, we worked on payments IPN improvements (Instant Payment
Notification) to provide asynchronous validation for embedded payments and other
improvements from customer feedback. Want to know more about it? Read
[the documentation about payments with Front-Commerce!](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/category/payments)
