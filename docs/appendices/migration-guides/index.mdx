## `2.18.0` -> `2.19.0`

### Replaced `mkdirp` package with `make-dir`

Due to
[a bug](https://github.com/isaacs/node-mkdirp/issues/31#issuecomment-777254013)
causing issues with our image resizer we have opted to replace the
[`mkdirp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mkdirp) package with
[`make-dir`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/make-dir) in our dependencies,
starting from version `2.19.0` we will no longer ship this package in
Front-Commerce, so if you are using `mkdirp` in your own code, you will need to
ensure that you have installed it.

```bash
npm install mkdirp@^1.0.4
```

### Allow report-only frames for Adyen

If you were using Adyen as a payment provider you might have allowed all iframes
to load, to prevent blocking 3DS2 authorization iframes from credit card
providers.

You can now restrict the policy again and use the `reportOnlyDirectives` feature
instead.

Although it will not strengthen the policy, this will allow to log loaded
iframes and help investigate risks of unsecure iframes.

```diff title="my-module/config/website.js"
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
-      frameSrc: ["*"],
+      frameSrc: ["*.adyen.com"],
    }
+    reportOnlyDirectives: {
+      frameSrc: true,
+    }
  },
```

### Configure the new logger

A new `security` logger has been added (for now to collect CSP violations).

Add it to your `logging.js` configuration to be able to see those logs (see
[the logging documentation](/docs/advanced/production-ready/logging.mdx) for
more details)

```js title="my-module/config/logging.js"
module.exports = {
  ...
  access: [
    {
      type: "console",
    },
  ],
  // highlight-start
  security: [
    {
      ...
    },
  ],
  // highlight-end
};
```

### Adding custom icons

We have improved the way you can add custom icons to your theme. Before you had
to override the
[`theme/components/atoms/Icon/Icon.js`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/src/web/theme/components/atoms/Icon/Icon.js)
file to add your custom icons. Now you can simply extend or override the core
icons with your custom icons by adding them to the
[`theme/components/atoms/Icon/icons/app-icons.js`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/src/web/theme/components/atoms/Icon/icons/app-icons.js)
file.

```js title="theme/components/atoms/Icon/icons/app-icons.js"
import { FcHome, FcPhone } from "react-icons/fc";

/** @type {Record<string, import("react-icons").IconType>} */
const componentIcons = {
  home: FcHome // this will override the `IoIosHome` icon from the core implementation
  phone: FcPhone // this will add a new icon
};

/** @type {string[]} */
const svgIcons = [];

export default {
  componentIcons,
  svgIcons,
};
```

:::important

To apply this change you need to restore the original `Icon.js` files, you can
do this by deleting the override from your custom theme.

:::

### Default country from graph

In this release, we have changed the usage of `default_country_id` defined in
your `stores.js` configuration.

From 2.19.0, this settings is directly exposed in the GraphQL API directly in
[`Country.isDefault`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/fa573a6cd5ad259d455acb70afeb56aacee5b30e/src/server/modules/front-commerce/country/schema.gql#L23)
field.

:::note

This field will use the value returned by Magento2, and default to the one
defined in your `stores.js` otherwise. In order to fully benefit from this
change, you will also have to update you Front-Commerce Magento 2 module to
version 2.8.4.

On other backends (Magento1, BigCommerce), this field will only expose the value
from your `stores.js`.

:::

**Breaking changes**: Previously, this setting was used directly in the frontend
in `web/theme/modules/User/Address/AddressForm/AddressForm.js`, and was removed
in favor of using the `isDefault` field in the graph. Please verify if you
overwrote any of these files:

- `web/theme/modules/User/Address/AddressForm/AddressForm.js`
- `web/theme/modules/User/Address/CountryFieldWithRegion/CountriesWithRegionQuery.gql`
- `web/theme/modules/User/Address/CountryFieldWithRegion/withCountriesAndRegions.js`

:::

### `Form/Item` `inline` property depreciation

To standardize the API of `theme/components/molecules/Form/Item` between the
default theme and the theme chocolatine, the `inline` property of that component
from the default theme has been deprecated to use an `appearance` property. So
if your project is not using the theme chocolatine and
`theme/components/molecules/Form/Item` explicitly receives the `inline`
property, you have to apply changes similar to:

```diff
 import FormItem from "theme/components/molecules/Form/Item";

 const MyComponent = () => {
   return (
-    <FormItem inline={true}>
+    <FormItem appearance="inline">
       <SomeComponent />
     </FormItem>
   );
}
```

or

```diff
 import FormItem from "theme/components/molecules/Form/Item";

 const MyComponent = () => {
   return (
-    <FormItem inline={false}>
+    <FormItem>
       <SomeComponent />
     </FormItem>
   );
}
```

### New features in `2.19.0`

- [The Stripe module can be configured to not automatically capture the payment](/docs/advanced/payments/stripe#advanced-disable-automatic-capture)
- [Report-Only <abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr> are now configurable](/docs/reference/content-security-policy.mdx)
- Magento2 performance improvements (opt-in)
  - [Ability to cache customers' cart](/docs/magento2/advanced#caching-customers-cart)
  - [Ability to cache current customers' information](/docs/magento2/advanced#caching-current-customers-information)
- [ChronoRelais shipping method support](/docs/advanced/shipping/chronorelais)

## `2.17.0` -> `2.18.0`

### The Prismic module has moved to a new home.

We have tagged the last version of the Prismic module in the
[external repository](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce-prismic)
`v1` 🥳

Since this version we have moved the Prismic module
[into the core repository](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/main/modules/prismic)
of Front-Commerce, moving forward any new features will be made available and
follow the same
[semantic versioning](/docs/appendices/release-process#semantic-versioning) as
the core.

You can use the module by adding the following changes to your
`.front-commerce.js` config file:

```diff title=".front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  modules: [
    "./node_modules/front-commerce/theme-chocolatine",
-   "./node_modules/front-commerce-prismic/prismic",
+   "./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/prismic",
    "./src",
  ],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    {
      name: "Magento2Elasticsearch",
      path: "datasource-elasticsearch/server/modules/magento2-elasticsearch",
    },
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
    { name: "Prismic", path: "prismic/server/modules/prismic" },
  ],
  webModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "front-commerce/src/web" },
-   {
-     name: "Prismic",
-     path: "./node_modules/front-commerce-prismic/prismic/web",
-   },
+   {
+     name: "Prismic",
+     path: "./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/prismic/web",
+   }
  ],
};
```

### path-to-regexp package added

We noticed that the
[`path-to-regexp`](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) package was
missing from our dependencies, it was only useable due to a transitive
dependency. We have added it to our dependencies to avoid any future issues.

The previous version of the package was `0.1.7` and we have upgraded it to
`6.2.1`. Because of others dependencies depending on older version of
`path-to-regexp`, you have to install it in your project in order to satisfy
Front-Commerce's requirements by running:

```
npm install path-to-regexp@^6.2.1
```

If you don't, you'll experience server side rendering errors like:

```
TypeError: Object(...) is not a function
      at /path/to/your/project/build/server/webpack:/node_modules/front-commerce/src/server/modules/magento2/catalog/products/urlMatchers.js:6:1
```

If you used this import without installing it in your project, the import
methods have changed.

```diff
- import pathToRegexp from "path-to-regexp";
+ import { pathToRegexp } from "path-to-regexp";
```

### Magento2 Adyen module update

In this release, we added support for version 8 of Magento2 Adyen module. If you
have a Front-Commerce setup where the module `Magento2/Adyen` is used,
[the `FRONT_COMMERCE_ADYEN_MAGENTO_MODULE_VERSION` environment variable is now required and it must contain the Magento2 module version](/docs/advanced/payments/adyen#add-the-required-environment-variables-1).

### DomainEvent implementations reworked

The `PaymentDetails` attribute was removed from the payment DomainEvents. A
custom paymentData last attribute now allows your payment methods to provide
custom JSON payload to the magento backend.

```diff
- new PaymentReceived(orderId, paymentDetails, pspReference)
+ new PaymentReceived(orderId, pspReference, paymentData)
```

Concerned classes : `PaymentAuthenticationStarted`, `PaymentAuthorized`,
`PaymentCaptured`, `PaymentCancelled`, `PaymentReceived` and `PaymentRefused`

### `FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_UNSAFE_USE_DEPRECATED_FIELDS` support removal

The support for the undocumented environment variable
`FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_UNSAFE_USE_DEPRECATED_FIELDS` has been removed in this
version. If you were previously defining this variable, you can safely remove
it. The main use case for this variable was to change `npm run lint` behavior so
that it triggers a warning instead of an error when a deprecated GraphQL is
used. This is now the default behavior.

### New Adobe Commerce B2B PHP module

Some B2B features were previously leveraging features from the
[Magento2 Commerce module](/docs/magento2/commerce#magento2-commerce-module-installation).
During this release, we've extracted B2B related features into their own
repository.

**If you work on an Adobe Commerce B2B project**, you must:

- update `front-commerce/magento2-commerce-module` to
  [version 2.x](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento2-commerce-module-front-commerce/-/releases)
  (currently `2.0.0`)
- install `front-commerce/magento2-b2b-module` to its latest version

Here are the commands to achieve this:

```shell
composer require front-commerce/magento2-commerce-module:2.0.0

composer config repositories.front-commerce-magento2-b2b git \
    git@gitlab.blackswift.cloud:front-commerce/magento2-b2b-module-front-commerce.git
composer require front-commerce/magento2-b2b-module:1.1.0

bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## `2.16.0` -> `2.17.0`

### Adyen's Stored payment methods

In this release, we added support for
[Adyen's Stored Payment Methods](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/magento-2/set-up-tokenization?tab=magento-vault-version-8-2-0_2#set-up-adyen-tokenization)
for its Magento module. For more information, see
[Adyen's Stored Payment Methods documentation](/docs/advanced/payments/adyen#enable-adyens-stored-payment-methods-optional).

### Payment workflow rework

We added a new frontend payment workflow for payment means using asynchronous
notifications. As most embedded payment methods will be migrated in the future,
please ensure you update the following files if you overrode them

```diff title="theme/modules/Checkout/PlaceOrder/PlaceOrder.js"
...
+import AsyncOrderQuery from "./AsyncOrderQuery.gql";

...

  EnhancePlaceOrder({
    SetPaymentInfoAndPlaceOrderMutation,
    SetCheckoutPaymentInformationAndRedirectMutation,
    PlaceOrderAndRedirectMutation,
+    AsyncOrderQuery,
  }),
  branch(
-    (props) => props.hasMessage,
+    (props) => props.message || props.errorMessage,
    () => ErrorOccured,
    (BaseComponent) => BaseComponent
  )
```

```diff title="theme/modules/Checkout/PlaceOrder/EnhancePlaceOrder.js"
...
+import withAsyncOrderAction from "./PaymentFlow/withAsyncOrderAction";


export const supportedPaymentFlowTypes = [
  "directOrder",
+  "asyncOrder",
  "redirectBeforeOrder",
  "redirectAfterOrder",
  "directOrderWithAdditionalAction",
  "workflowAgnosticCheckout",
];

const EnhancePlaceOrder = ({
  SetPaymentInfoAndPlaceOrderMutation,
  SetCheckoutPaymentInformationAndRedirectMutation,
  PlaceOrderAndRedirectMutation,
+  AsyncOrderQuery,
}) =>
...
    withHandlers({
      onError:
        (props) =>
        ({ errorMessage }) =>
          props.formatErrorMessage(errorMessage),
    }),
+    withAsyncOrderAction(AsyncOrderQuery),
    makeCommandDispatcher({

```

### DomainEvent rework

The DomainEvent class was reworked.

If you handled payment events on orders (backend operation) using
[DomainEvent implementations](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/main/src/server/modules/front-commerce/payment/domain/events),
these implementations now base on a `PurchaseIdentifier` instead of a direct
`orderId` (this allows to update order events based on a cartId)

Here is the new usage for those classes

```diff
new PaymentCaptured(
-  orderId,
+  new PurchaseIdentifier({ orderId }),
  paymentDetail
)
```

### Payzen/Lyra on Magento1

We migrated the Payzen/Lyra embedded payment module for Magento2 to the new
`asyncOrder` payment workflow.

As this is not supported for Magento1, override
`theme/pages/Checkout/checkoutFlowOf.js` to keep using the former workflow.

```diff title="theme/pages/Checkout/checkoutFlowOf.js"

const checkoutFlowOf = (method) => {
  ...

-  if (method === "payzen_embedded") return "asyncOrder";
+  if (method === "payzen_embedded") return "directOrder";

  ...
};
```

<hr className="my-10" />

## `2.15.0` -> `2.16.0`

Updating Front-Commerce from 2.15.0 to 2.16.0 does not require any manual
operation.

<hr className="my-10" />

## `2.14.0` -> `2.15.0`

### Environment variables: quote values containing `#` or ``` characters

As part of our continuous dependencies upgrade process, we've upgraded the
`dotenv` dependency to its latest version. We've updated it from version `8.2.0`
(October 2019) to version `16.0.0` (February 2022). Technically, **it contains 2
Breaking Changes** that we've decided to be pragmatic about.
[We prioritized having an up-to-date dependency with a minor migration check, over an outdated one for pure SemVer compatibility.](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/1231#note_927541557)
Please check that your environment variables are not impacted by these breaking
changes:

1. [**15.0.0**](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1500-2022-01-31):
   `#` marks the beginning of a comment (UNLESS the value is wrapped in quotes.
   Please update your `.env` files to wrap in quotes any values containing `#`:
1. [**16.0.0**](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1600-2022-02-02):
   If you had values containing the backtick character, please quote those
   values with either single or double quotes.

```diff
- SECRET_WITH_HASH=something-with-a-#-hash
- SECRET_WITH_BACKTICK=something-with-a-`-backtick
+ SECRET_WITH_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
+ SECRET_WITH_BACKTICK="something-with-a-`-backtick"
```

:::info

you can change your environment variables **right away**. Quoted values also
work with previous Front-Commerce versions.

:::

### In-Stock Alerts

In this release, we introduced the In-Stock Alert feature. When this feature is
enabled on your backend (Magento 1 and 2), it will by default render a new
component `SubscribeToInStockAlert` inside the existing `OutOfStock` component.

### Paginated orders

In this release we added pagination for orders. In the process, the `orders`
GraphQL field used to retrieve orders has been deprecated and will eventually be
removed in FC version 3.0.0. `orderList` should now be used instead. If you had
overridden the `Orders` (`theme/pages/Account/Orders/Orders.js`) component, you
might want to update it to use the new GraphQL field and add a pagination
component.

### Node Version Support Change

We now support Node versions 14, 16 and 17 (Node 17 is supported on a best
effort basis). If you are using Node 12
([which reached its end of life](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)), you
must update your Node version (we recommend Node 16). To support these latest
Node versions, we had to upgrade some dependencies. These upgrades imply changes
that could impact your codebase:

- You need to update to the latest version of your `front-commerce-skeleton`
- `@apollo/*` are only installed as sub-dependencies and therefore **should not
  be used directly**. In `2.15.0` you need to replace all uses of `@apollo/*` in
  your codebase with `react-apollo`, or `graphql-tag` imports where applicable.

- If after the above fixes there is still `@apollo/*` dependencies and you are
  not sure how to resolve please <ContactLink /> for support. You can also check
  [here](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/1215/diffs?commit_id=8fae8438d46200cbd310b16c30b3078da28b7d42)
  and
  [here](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/1215/diffs?commit_id=418a291f917660b18672b6be2eb2778cb51dfef9)
  for the changes we did to our codebase.
- Resolvers for fields that are not in the `schema` now throw errors. To avoid
  this remove all unneeded `field`/`Type` resolvers that do not have a
  representation in the GraphQL `schema`. Check our
  [cleaning commit](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/1216/diffs?commit_id=1e2e04e7f28dba2ebd36da50701478a13a58a238)
  regarding this issue.
- `makeApolloClientStub` now expects resolvers as an argument instead of mocks.
  This is in tandem with the
  [`graphql-tools` upgrade notes](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/mocking#migration-from-v7-and-below).
  Note that we provided an adapter that converts `mocks` to `resolvers` so that
  old tests are not affected. However it is recommended to make the change. To
  disable the adapter's warning set
  `FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_PRINT_MAKEAPOLLOCLIENTSTUB_MOCKS_DEPRECATION_WARNING`
  environment variable to `"false"`.
- The use of `SchemaVisitor`/`SchemaDirectiveVisitor` to implement GraphQL
  directive is deprecated and it is replaced by the use of the
  [new API](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/schema-directives). We
  implemented an adapter so that uses of
  `SchemaVisitor`/`SchemaDirectiveVisitor` will not break, however it is
  recommended to make the change. Please note that the adapter only supports the
  use of `visitFieldDefinition` function of the
  `SchemaVisitor`/`SchemaDirectiveVisitor` class. If you have use for other
  functions and cannot make the change to the new API please <ContactLink /> for
  help.
- When using Node 17 you need to prefix your npm commands by
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` e.g.
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm start`,
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm run build`.
- When using npm >= 7 you need to add `--legacy-peer-deps` to npm install
  commands. e.g. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`,
  `npm i some_dependency --legacy-peer-deps`.

- Reinstall your dependencies after the update:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="For npm >= 7">
```

```sh
rm -rf ./node_modules/
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="For npm < 7">
```

```shell
rm -rf ./node_modules/
npm install
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### New features in `2.15.0`

<hr className="my-10" />

## `2.13.0` -> `2.14.0`

### New style sheet for B2B

In this release we updated the RequisitionList configurable options modal. In
case you are using the B2B module and have overridden
`modules/front-commerce-b2b/web/theme/modules/RequisitionList/_RequisitionList.scss`
please add the following line to it:

```scss
@import "~theme/modules/RequisitionList/ProductConfigurationModal/ProductConfigurationModal";
```

### `withFlashMessages` now exports hooks

The logic of `withFlashMessages` is now also exported as a hook
`useFlashMessages`. If you have overridden `withFlashMessages` please apply the
changes in
[this diff](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/11e7d55bc68d22b422ea5bc9c8357551cd2412ea)
to it.

### Added downloadable products support for Magento2

> _Minimum required magento 2 module version 2.6.1_

Support for shareable downloadable products was added. There is now a new page
under the user account `/user/downloadable-products` that lists all the
downloadable products of the current user.

P.S. The [withFlashMessage](#withflashmessages-now-exports-hooks) update is
required for the downloadable product page.

To add a link to the downloadable products in the account navigation please
apply the following diffs to your project:

If you are using the base theme:

- [AccountNavigation](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/6f83e7b889369efab8a2560c66a410a1b3a6f7db?view=parallel#9f4b70799a5d0472977d4a6992b5f751d4c7b2a3)
- [AccountLayout](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/6f83e7b889369efab8a2560c66a410a1b3a6f7db?page=2#a85a9f3a6d6111152efe2fc74320dfab7295d39d)
- [EnhanceAccount](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/6f83e7b889369efab8a2560c66a410a1b3a6f7db?page=2#92527070b393735c35c5825b3174987e566962e6)
- [\_modules.scss](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/6f83e7b889369efab8a2560c66a410a1b3a6f7db?page=2#f9a39a6723f4100486c2658dff702698421eae41)

If you are using theme chocolatine:

- [AccountNavigation](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/6f83e7b889369efab8a2560c66a410a1b3a6f7db?page=2#e7af65f5100c0e8b1d5bda98a735eb5744a44386)
- [AccountLayout](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/6f83e7b889369efab8a2560c66a410a1b3a6f7db?page=2#f7e1de354176dd6902903dc889133f0c5f2733e3)

### PaymentMethodLabel relocated

The `<PaymentMethodLabel>` component was moved from
`theme/modules/User/Order/OrderMethod/PaymentMethodLabel.js` to
`theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/PaymentMethodLabel.js` the old location will
still work but will output deprecation messages when used. If you have overriden
`<PaymentMethodLabel>` you should also relocate your override to the same path
and update all references to point to it.

As a consequence of relocating `<PaymentMethodLabel>` we had to rename all the
translation keys it uses. As such the following translation keys have been
updated

| Old Key                                                        | New Key                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| modules.User.Order.OrderMethod.PaymentMethod.checkmo           | modules.Checkout.Payment.PaymentMethodLabel.checkmo           |
| modules.User.Order.OrderMethod.PaymentMethod.ogoneFlexcheckout | modules.Checkout.Payment.PaymentMethodLabel.ogoneFlexcheckout |
| modules.User.Order.OrderMethod.PaymentMethod.paymentOnAccount  | modules.Checkout.Payment.PaymentMethodLabel.paymentOnAccount  |
| modules.User.Order.OrderMethod.PaymentMethod.paypalButton      | modules.Checkout.Payment.PaymentMethodLabel.paypalButton      |
| modules.User.Order.OrderMethod.PaymentMethod.paypalExpress     | modules.Checkout.Payment.PaymentMethodLabel.paypalExpress     |
| modules.User.Order.OrderMethod.PaymentMethod.paypalStandard    | modules.Checkout.Payment.PaymentMethodLabel.paypalStandard    |
| modules.User.Order.OrderMethod.PaymentMethod.payzenEmbedded    | modules.Checkout.Payment.PaymentMethodLabel.payzenEmbedded    |
| modules.User.Order.OrderMethod.PaymentMethod.stripe            | modules.Checkout.Payment.PaymentMethodLabel.stripe            |
| modules.User.Order.OrderMethod.PaymentMethod.hipay             | modules.Checkout.Payment.PaymentMethodLabel.hipay             |

All translation keys that start with
`modules.User.Order.OrderMethod.PaymentMethod` now starts with
`modules.Checkout.Payment.PaymentMethodLabel`. You need to update any use of the
old keys (if any) in your project to the respective new key.

### Update your CSPs

In this release, we have removed most of the module-related CSPs from
Front-Commerce default configuration file. If you are using one or more of the
following modules, please do update your CSPs accordingly in your
`config/website.js` configuration:

- `Google Analytics` or `Google Tag Manager` (see
  [analytics configuration](/docs/advanced/analytics/legacy#universal-analytics-google-analytics))
- `Paypal` (see
  [Paypal configuration](/docs/advanced/payments/paypal#update-your-csps))
- `Payzen` (see
  [Payzen configuration](/docs/advanced/payments/payzen#update-your-csps))

### Removed deprecations in `Button` component

The properties that were tagged as deprecated in
`theme/components/atoms/Button/Button.js` before version 2.0 have been removed
in this release:

- `appearance` should now be used instead of `primary`, `icon`, `link` and
  `warning`.
- `state` should now be used instead of `disabled` and `pending`.

Please update your code to fit the new behavior.

### Code clean up

In this release, we have removed some dead and unused code
([see corresponding MR](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/967)):

- `src/theme/pages/Account/Account.js` that despites its name is not used at all
  and very unlikely to be used by any project
- some loadable routes from `src/web/LoadableRoutes.js` there were useless since
  the addition of file based routing in `2.0.0-rc.0`.

<p>
  If you have trouble about those removals while upgrading, please{" "}
  <ContactLink />.
</p>

### Fixed the Front-Commerce B2B module's company credit display

In the account menu we displayed the company credit menu even for companies not
allowed to pay on account.

If you overrode `FirstnameQuery.gql` add the following code

```diff title="modules/front-commerce-b2b/web/theme/pages/Account/FirstnameQuery.gql"
query Firstname {
  me {
    ...
    company {
      name
+      credit {
+        availableCredit {
+          amount
+        }
+      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you overrode `AccountNavigation.js` perform the following changes

```diff title="theme/modules/User/AccountNavigation/AccountNavigation.js"
...

const isCompanyUser = (user) => {
  return Boolean(user?.company);
};

+const isCompanyCreditsAllowed = (user) => {
+  return Boolean(user?.company?.credit);
+};

...
-     isCompanyUser(user) && {
+     isCompanyCreditsAllowed(user) && {
        value: "/user/company/credit",
        label: intl.formatMessage(messages.companyCredit),
      },
...
-       {isCompanyUser(user) && (
+       {isCompanyCreditsAllowed(user) && (
          <Route
            exact
            path={`${basePath}/company/credit`}
            children={({ match }) => (
              <Link to="/user/company/credit" className={makeClassName(match)}>
                {intl.formatMessage(messages.companyCredit)}
                <Icon icon="cash" title="" />
              </Link>
            )}
          />
...
```

### New features in `2.14.0`

- [Custom routable pages now supports dynamic GraphQL variables from URL](/docs/advanced/theme/route-dispatcher#advanced-queries)
- [New `FRONT_COMMERCE_GRAPHQL_PERSISTED_QUERIES_DISABLE` environment variable for temporarily deactivating the GraphQL Persisted Queries feature](/docs/reference/environment-variables#server)
- New Prismic module features:
  - Support for [trailing slashes](/docs/prismic/routable-types#trailing-slash)
  - Support for [path rewrites](/docs/prismic/routable-types#path-rewrites)
  - Exposed the `url` to the
    [Content type](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce-prismic/-/blob/main/prismic/server/modules/prismic/core/loaders/Content.js)

:::note

When a Prismic document has been registered using the
[`registerRoutableType`](/docs/prismic/routable-types#registerroutabletype-options)
method or the
[`registerPrismicRoute`](/docs/prismic/routable-types#registerprismicroute-options)
method, A `url` property is exposed in the
[Content type object](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce-prismic/-/blob/main/prismic/server/modules/prismic/core/loaders/Content.js).
This property contains the resolved url of the document.

The `front-commerce-prismic` module is now using the latest version of prismic.

```shell
npm install git+ssh://git@gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce-prismic.git#1.0.0
```

The most notable breaking changes is the removal of the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_PRISMIC_URL` and the inclusion of the `path` option for the
`registerRoutableType` method.

:::info

You can refer to the `front-commerce-prismic` module
[changelog](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce-prismic/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

:::

#### `FRONT_COMMERCE_PRISMIC_URL` has been removed

The environment variable `FRONT_COMMERCE_PRISMIC_URL` has been removed. Please
use `FRONT_COMMERCE_PRISMIC_REPOSITORY_NAME` instead.

```diff title=".env"
- FRONT_COMMERCE_PRISMIC_URL=https://my-repo.prismic.io
+ FRONT_COMMERCE_PRISMIC_REPOSITORY_NAME=my-repo
```

#### Improved the `registerRoutableType` method

- A new required property has been added for dynamic routes: `path` <br />
  Examples: `/:uid`, `/:lang/:uid`, `/:category*/:uid`,
  `/:section/:category?/:uid`.

  :::tip ProTip™

  You can use the online
  [express-route-tester@2.0.0](http://forbeslindesay.github.io/express-route-tester)
  to test your paths.

  :::

- A new `resolvers` property to allow the nested routes content relationship
  resolution.

  ```diff
    PrismicLoader.registerRoutableType({
      typeIdentifier: "album", // document type "album" will resolve to path `/albums/:uid`
  -   path: "/album/:uid",     // "/album/queen"
  +   path: "/:category/:uid", // "/rock-and-roll/queen"
  +   resolvers: {
  +     category: "category"   // identifier of the Content Relationship in the album Custom Type
  +   },
      ...
    })
  ```

:::warning Depth Limit

The Route Resolver is limited to retrieving data from 2 levels deep, please see
the
[Route Resolver example](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/route-resolver-nuxtjs#route-resolver-examples)
for more information.

:::

#### `@prismicio/client` has been updated to v6

See https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/prismic-client-v6-migration-guide for
the complete migration guide

The new predicate object contains the same predicate functions as Predicates
with new names to better match the API's predicate names.

```diff
- import { Predicates } from "@prismicio/client";
+ import * as prismic from "@prismicio/client";
const query = new ListQuery(10)
- query.addPredicate(prismic.Predicates.gt('my.movie.rating', 3))
+ query.addPredicate(prismic.predicate.numberGreaterThan('my.movie.rating', 3))
```

The following `predicates` have been renamed:

- `dayOfMonth` → `dateDayOfMonth`
- `dayOfMonthAfter` → `dateDayOfMonthAfter`
- `dayOfMonthBefore` → `dateDayOfMonthBefore`
- `dayOfWeek` → `dateDayOfWeek`
- `dayOfWeekAfter` → `dateDayOfWeekAfter`
- `dayOfWeekBefore` → `dateDayOfWeekBefore`
- `month` → `dateMonth`
- `monthBefore` → `dateMonthBefore`
- `monthAfter` → `dateMonthAfter`
- `year` → `dateYear`
- `hour` → `dateHour`
- `hourBefore` → `dateHourBefore`
- `hourAfter` → `dateHourAfter`
- `gt` → `numberGreaterThan`
- `lt` → `numberLessThan`
- `inRange` → `numberInRange`
- `near` → `geopointNear`

#### `prismic-dom` replaced with `@prismicio/helpers`

See https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/prismic-helpers-v2-migration-guide for
the complete migration guide

### Added FlashMessages to the Order Details

For the HiPay payment method, FlashMessages may be shown at the order detail
level for errors.

If you overrode `<OrderDetailsLayout>` add the following lines to it

```diff
+ import FlashMessages from "theme/modules/FlashMessages";
...
  return (
    <div
      className={classNames("order-details-layout", {
        "account-orders-details--no-actions": !showOrderActions,
      })}
    >
+  <FlashMessages />
...
```

### Login Form Update

For the external logins feature `<AdditionalLoginFormActions>` and
`<FlashMessages>` have been added to the `<LoginForm>`.

If you overrode `<LoginForm>` please add the following lines to it

```diff
...
+import AdditionalLoginFormActions from "theme/modules/User/LoginForm/AdditionalLoginFormActions";
+import FlashMessages from "theme/modules/FlashMessages";
...
          {props.errorMessage && <ErrorAlert>{props.errorMessage}</ErrorAlert>}
+          <FlashMessages />
...
            </SubmitButton>
+            <AdditionalLoginFormActions />
          </FormActions>
...
```

### New icons required

In this release, these new icons were added `google`, `facebook` to the `<Icon>`
component `theme/components/atoms/Icon/Icon.js`.

If you have overridden the `<Icon>` component, you need to add the icons as
follows to the list of icons to avoid any error messages at page loading:

```diff
-import { FaUserCircle } from "react-icons/fa";
+import { FaUserCircle, FaFacebook, FaGoogle } from "react-icons/fa";
const keyToComponent = {
  ...
  organigram: GiOrganigram,
  gripper: VscGripper,
+  facebook: FaFacebook,
+  google: FaGoogle,
};
```

### New features in `2.13.0`

These new features may be relevant for your existing application:

- [Search for products, categories and pages with Algolia in Magento2 based project](/docs/magento2/search-engine#algolia)
- [Search for categories and pages with Algolia in Magento1 based project](/docs/magento1/search-engine#algolia)
- [Prismic Preview](/docs/prismic/preview)
- [HiPay payment method](/docs/advanced/payments/hipay)
- [Facebook and Google external logins](/docs/advanced/features/external-logins)

<hr className="my-10" />

## `2.11.0` -> `2.12.0`

### Upgrade the Magento2 module

If you are using Magento2, version 2.5.0 of `front-commerce/magento2-module` is
now the minimum required version. To update it to the last version, from
Magento2 root, you can run:

```sh
composer update front-commerce/magento2-module
```

### Homogenize the `Map` components

To ensure a more consistent usage we have homogenize the props of the map
components and we added a few fixes.

- The `LocationInternalShape` has been deprecated in favor of
  `LocationInputShape`.
- The `CoordinatesShape` now accepts either {`latitude`,`longitude`} or
  {`lat`,`lng`}.
- Included the `onBoundsChanged` prop in the `Map` components

:::info

For a list of available props for the map and marker components see:
[Display a map](/docs/advanced/features/display-a-map#component-props)

:::

### `carousel` image format

To support
[the Slider and Slider Magento2 page builder content types](/docs/magento2/page-builder),
we have moved the `<Carousel />` component from theme chocolatine to the default
theme. If you plan to use this component directly or through the page builder
Slider, you must add a `carousel` image format to your `src/config/images.js`:

```diff title="src/config/images.js"
@@ -6,6 +6,7 @@ module.exports = {
     large: { width: 1100, height: 1100, bgColors: [] },
+    carousel: { width: 1280, height: 600, bgColors: [] },
     zoomable: { width: 1100, height: 1100, bgColors: [], sizes: [2] },
   },
 };
```

### `swatch` image format in base theme

We backported the `swatch` image format from theme chocolatine to base theme.
This image format is used to display product images of a requisition list. If
you are using the base theme and want to use the requisition list feature of the
B2B module you have to add the swatch image format to your
`src/config/images.js` as follows:

```diff title="src/config/images.js"
module.exports = {
  defaultBgColor: "FFFFFF",
  presets: {
...
+    swatch: { width: 26, height: 26, bgColors: [] },
...
  },
};
```

### Smarter image resizing mechanism

In this release, we have improved the image resizing mechanism to be bit
smarter. Before this release, a check on the requested file extension was done
before trying to resize an image. As of this release, this check has been
removed and it's now up to the underlying image processing library to check if
this file is a image or not. As a result, out of the box, more image file
formats can be processed without any configuration. The `extensions` setting
from `config/images.js` becomes useless and is now deprecated. You should remove
it from your application:

```diff title="src/config/images.js"
    large: { width: 1100, height: 1100, bgColors: [] }
  },
-  extensions: [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png"]
};
```

### Added requisition list features to B2B module (only theme chocolatine suported)

If you are using base theme and wish to use the B2B module you have to override
`theme/modules/ProductView/Synthesis/AddProductToCart.js` from the base theme
and provide a way to add to requisition list from the product page (see
[AddProductToRequisitionList](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/2.12.0/modules/front-commerce-b2b/web/theme/modules/RequisitionList/AddProductToRequisitionList/AddProductToRequisitionList.js)
and
[B2B's AddProductToCart](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/2.12.0/modules/front-commerce-b2b/web/theme/modules/ProductView/Synthesis/AddProductToCart.js)
for inspiration). You also need to override
`theme/modules/AddToCart/_AddToCart.scss` if you have not already and just copy
the styles from the base theme to it
(`src/web/theme/modules/AddToCart/_AddToCart.scss`).

If you are using theme chocolatine and have overridden
`theme/modules/ProductView/Synthesis/AddProductToCart.js` and want to use the
B2B module you need to apply the following change to it:

```diff
...
+import AddProductToRequisitionList from "theme/modules/RequisitionList/AddProductToRequisitionList";
...
      <AddToCart
        appearance={appearance}
        selectedOptions={selectedOptions}
        selectedCustomOptions={selectedCustomOptions}
        selectedBundleOptions={selectedBundleOptions}
        onProductAdded={onProductAdded}
        product={withComputedPrice(product)}
        label={intl.formatMessage(messages.addToCartLabel)}
        unavailableLabel={intl.formatMessage(messages.unavailableLabel)}
        actions={
-          withWishlist !== false && (
+          <>
+            {withWishlist !== false && (
              <AddProductToWishlist
                sku={product.sku}
                selectedOptions={selectedOptions}
                selectedCustomOptions={selectedCustomOptions}
                selectedBundleOptions={selectedBundleOptions}
                size="big"
              />
-            )
+            )}
+            <AddProductToRequisitionList
+              product={product}
+              selectedConfigurableOptions={selectedOptions}
+              size="big"
+            />
+          </>
        }
      />
...
```

If you overrode `theme/modules/Cart/CartTitle/CartTitle.js` you need to apply
the following diff to it:

```diff
...
+import AddCartToRequisitionList from "../../RequisitionList/AddCartToRequisitionList";
...
        <FormActions appearance="center">
+          <AddCartToRequisitionList cart={props.cart} size="big" />
          {hasCartError ? (
            <Button onDisableClick={() => {}} state="disabled">
              <ProceedToCheckout />
            </Button>
          ) : (
            <Link to="/checkout" buttonAppearance="primary">
              <ProceedToCheckout />
            </Link>
          )}
        </FormActions>
...
```

### Cookies max age configuration

The `cookieMaxAgeInMonths` configuration in `src/config/website.js` represents
the consent cookie's maxage in months. It now has a default value of **12
months**. Previously if left unconfigured the cookie banner will appear to users
every time they visit the site.

#### New links added to `<AccountNavigation>`

The company structure and requisition list links are added to the
`<AccountNavigation>` component. Those links are part of the B2B features so if
you need them and overrode the `<AccountNavigation>` component you need to apply
the below diff to your overridden `<AccountNavigation>`:

```mdx-code-block
<details>
<summary><strong>"AccountNavigation" diff (click to expand diff)</strong></summary>
```

```diff
import React from "react";
...
const messages = defineMessages({
...
+  companyStructureLink: {
+    id: "pages.Account.Navigation.companyStructure",
+    defaultMessage: "Company structure",
+  },
...
+  requisitionListsLink: {
+    id: "pages.Account.Navigation.requisitionLists",
+    defaultMessage: "Your requisition lists",
+  },
...
});

+                </Link>
+              )}
+            />
          </>
        ) : null}
...
+        {requisitionList?.isFeatureActive && (

+                <Icon icon="list" title="" />
+              </Link>
+            )}
+          />
+        )}
...
      </nav>
    );
  }
);
```

```mdx-code-block
</details>
```

### New style sheets

If you overrode `theme/components/_components.scss` you need to add the
following line to it

```scss
@import "~theme/components/molecules/LoadingOverlay/LoadingOverlay";
@import "~theme/components/molecules/SelectMenu/SelectMenu";
```

If you overrode `theme/components/_modules.scss` you need to add the following
line to it to use the `<ProductPicker>` component (used by
[the QuickOrder feature](/docs/advanced/features/quickorder))

```scss
@import "~theme/modules/ProductPicker/ProductPicker";
```

If you are using the B2B module and overrode `theme/_b2b.scss` you need to add
the following lines to it

```scss
@import "~theme/components/organisms/Tree/Tree";
@import "~theme/modules/Company/CompanyStructure/CompanyStructure";
@import "~theme/modules/RequisitionList/RequisitionList";
@import "~theme/modules/RequisitionList/RequisitionListTable/RequisitionListTable";
```

If you overrode `src/web/theme/components/atoms/Button/_Button.scss` apply the
following diff to it:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Base theme diff">
```

```diff
...
+.button--disabled {
+  &:hover,
+  &:focus {
+    background: $white;
+  }
+}
...
.button--disabled {
+  &,
+  &:hover,
+  &:focus,
+  &:active {
+    background: $white;
+    text-decoration: none;
    cursor: not-allowed;
    border-color: $shade04;
    background: $white;
    color: $shade04;
    &.button--primary {
      border-color: $shade04;
      background: $shade04;
      color: $white;
    }
    &.button--icon {
      background: transparent;
      color: $shade04;
    }
+  }
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Theme chocolatine diff">
```

```diff
...
.button--disabled {
  border-color: $shade03;
  &:hover,
- &:focus {
+ &:focus,
+ &:active {
    background: $white;
  }
}
...
.button--disabled {
-  cursor: not-allowed;
-
-  &,
-  &:hover {
+  &,
+  &:hover,
+  &:focus,
+  &:active {
+    text-decoration: none;
+    cursor: not-allowed;
    border-color: $shade03;
    background: $white;
    color: $shade03;
    &.button--primary {
      border-color: $shade03;
      background: $shade03;
      color: $fontColor;
    }
  }
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

if you overrode `theme/modules/AddToCart/_AddToCart.scss` and are using theme
chocolatine apply the following diff to it:

```diff
...
  &__actions {
    display: none;
    padding: math.div($boxSizeMargin, 2);
    @media screen and (min-width: $menuBreakpoint) {
      display: block;
    }
  }
  &__actions {
-    display: none;
+    display: flex;
    padding: math.div($boxSizeMargin, 2);
-    @media screen and (min-width: $menuBreakpoint) {
-      display: block;
-    }
+    > * {
+      margin-left: math.div($boxSizeMargin, 2);
+    }
+    :first-child {
+      margin-left: 0;
+    }
  }...
```

### New icons required

In this release, these new icons were added `eye-off`, `user-circle`,
`organigram` and `gripper` to the `<Icon>` component
`theme/components/atoms/Icon/Icon.js`.

If you have overridden the `<Icon>` component, you need to add the icons as
follows to the list of icons to avoid any error messages at page loading:

```diff
import {
  ...
+ IoIosEyeOff,
} from "react-icons/io";
+import { FaUserCircle } from "react-icons/fa";
+import { GiOrganigram } from "react-icons/gi";
+import { VscGripper } from "react-icons/vsc";
const keyToComponent = {
  ...
  eye: IoIosEye,
+ "eye-off": IoIosEyeOff,
  pencil: IoMdCreate,
  ...
+  "user-circle": FaUserCircle,
+  organigram: GiOrganigram,
+  gripper: VscGripper,
};
```

### Password field updated with a show/hide feature

The `<Password>` input now displays a show/hide icon allowing users to reveal
their password. It is enabled by default. You can opt-out this feature using the
`disableShowPassword` prop:

```diff
<Password
  id="password"
  name="password"
  required
+ disableShowPassword
/>
```

This new `Password` component requires a stylesheet to add in the
`_components.scss` file if you overrode it.

```diff
// theme/components/_components.scss
...
@import "~theme/components/atoms/Form/Label/Label";
+@import "~theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Password/Password";
@import "~theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Select/Select";
...
```

If you overrode the `_Input.scss` file, you may need to indicate the inputs
height by adding an `input-height` class to correct the vertical alignment of
the icon.

```diff
// theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/_Input.scss
input,
+.input-height,
select {
  height: 3.4rem;
}
```

### New `<PasswordStrengthHint>` component in default forms

We've included a `<PasswordStrengthHint>` to provide a better feedback to users
about the expected password complexity.

> If you don't want to use this feature in your application, please follow the
> [Disable password strength hints](/docs/advanced/features/password-fields#disable-password-strength-hints)
> guide Please update the files below, to ensure that your application displays
> user forms consistently:

```diff
// theme/components/_components.scss
+@import "~theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/PasswordStrengthHint/PasswordStrengthHint";
+@import "~theme/components/atoms/ProgressStatus/ProgressStatus";
```

```diff
// theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/index.js
+import PasswordStrengthHint from "./PasswordStrengthHint";
export {
  ...
+ PasswordStrengthHint,
};
```

You should add the `<PasswordStrengthHint>` component in every override using
the `<Password>` input. In the default theme, the following components were
affected:

- `theme/modules/User/RegisterForm/RegisterForm.js`
- `theme/pages/Account/Information/ChangeUserPasswordForm.js`
- `theme/pages/PasswordManagment/PasswordReset/PasswordReset.js`
- `theme/modules/User/PasswordManagement/PasswordResetForm/PasswordResetForm.js`

Here is an example of the changes involved to use this component (usually added
after the `<Password>` field):

```diff
+import PasswordStrengthHint from "theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/PasswordStrengthHint/PasswordStrengthHint";
<Password
  name="password"
  ...
/>
+ <PasswordStrengthHint
+  formValuePath="password" // must equal the password name value
+/>
```

### `passwordValidation` deprecation

The file `theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Password/passwordValidation.js` is
now deprecated. If you overrode it, you must also override the password validity
configuration in `theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Password/passwordConfig.js`
(introduced in this release).

See
[the password field's documentation](/docs/advanced/features/password-fields#configure-password-validity)
for more details on the password field validation configuration.

If you overrode some of the following components:

- `theme/modules/User/RegisterForm/RegisterForm.js`
- `theme/pages/Account/Information/ChangeUserPasswordForm.js`
- `theme/pages/PasswordManagment/PasswordReset/PasswordReset.js`
- `theme/modules/User/PasswordManagement/PasswordResetForm/PasswordResetForm.js`

You must use the new
`src/web/theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Password/passwordFieldValidator.js`
instead of the deprecated `passwordValidation` as follow:

```diff
-import {
-  isPasswordValid,
-  errorMessage,
-  MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH,
-  MIN_CHAR_CLASSES,
-} from "theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Password/passwordValidation";
+import {
+  passwordValidationRules,
+  passwordValidationErrors,
+} from "theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/Password/passwordFieldValidator";
...
<Password
  name="password"
- validations={{
-   magentoPasswordRule: (_, value) => isPasswordValid(value),
- }}
+ validations={passwordValidationRules}
- validationError={intl.formatMessage(errorMessage, {
-   minLength: MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH,
-   minClasses: MIN_CHAR_CLASSES,
- })}
+ validationError={passwordValidationErrors}
/>
```

### New Confirmation Modal

We added a new `<ConfirmationModal>` in `theme/components/organisms/Modal`. If
you overrode the `theme/components/organisms/Modal/index.js` file please add the
following lines to ensure that the confirmation modal works :

```diff
+import ConfirmationModal from "./ConfirmationModal/ConfirmationModal";
-export { CloseModal };
+export { CloseModal, ConfirmationModal };
```

### New features in `2.12.0`

These new features may be relevant for your existing application:

- Page builder: Slider content type and Slide support
- the `<Password>` component now allows the user to reveal the password
- New component: `<PasswordStrengthHint>` to show hints of password's strength
  criterias to the user
- New component: `<ProgressStatus>` to show a progressbar with a label
- New component: `<ConfirmationModal>` to simplify confirmation modals

<hr className="my-10" />

## `2.10.0` -> `2.11.0`

### Zoom-in on product images

In this release, we have added the ability for customers to zoom in on product
images in the product page. For that, we have implemented
[a `<Ligthbox />` component](https://magento2.front-commerce.app/styleguide/?path=/story/modules-organisms-lightbox--with-images)
that leverages
[react-image-lightbox library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-lightbox)
behind the scene.

This feature is enabled by default in both in theme Chocolatine and in the base
theme. **You MUST decide whether you want it or not and follow the related
instructions below:**

- [Integrating the zoom in feature](#integrating-the-zoom-in-feature)
- or [Disabling the zoom in feature](#disabling-the-zoom-in-feature)

#### Disabling the zoom in feature

This feature is controlled by the `enableZoomOnImage` property of the product
`<Gallery />` component in the base theme or the `<GalleryWithCarousel />`
component in theme Chocolatine. So If you want to disable this feature and one
of these components is used in your integration, you can pass `false` in the
`enableZoomOnImage` property.

:::note

In the base theme, the `<Gallery />` component is rendered by
`theme/modules/ProductView/ProductView`, while in theme Chocolatine, the
`<GalleryWithCarousel />` is rendered by
`theme/modules/ProductView/Gallery/Gallery`.

:::

#### Integrating the zoom in feature

If you want to add that feature to your project you have to define an image
format named `zoomable`. For instance, we have added one in
[the last version of the Skeleton](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce-skeleton/-/commit/4b0d4175f9468c47e1a9af9329f3856c2b00c025)
but the actual format parameters depends on your project constraints.

:::note

`zoomable` is the default image format used by the `<Lightbox />` component to
render the image on which the customer can zoom in. This component accepts an
`imageFormat` property in which you can pass an other image format.

:::

Then, depending on the amount of customization, you might also have to bring
changes similar to what we have done in the merge requests for that feature:

- https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/699/diffs
- https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/717/diffs
- https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/719/diffs

In a nutshell, when the feature is enabled, we place a transparent button on top
of the product image; if the customer clicks on it, we then render a
`<Lightbox />` for that image.

### MondialRelay shipping in a Magento2 based project

In this version, we have improved the MondialRelay shipping support with
Magento2 so that a customer can only choose a pickup point suitable for the
products being ordered. This improvement requires an update of Magentix's module
to
[install at least the version 100.10.7](/docs/advanced/shipping/mondial-relay#integrate-with-magento2).

### New icons required

In this release, two new icons (`warn` and `users`) were added to
[the `<Icon>` component](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/src/web/theme/components/atoms/Icon/Icon.js).

If you have overridden the `<Icon>` component, you need to add both icons as
follows to the list of icons to avoid any error messages at page loading:

```diff
import {
  ...
+ IoIosWarning,
+ IoIosPeople,
} from "react-icons/io";
const keyToComponent = {
  ...
+ warn: IoIosWarning,
+ users: IoIosPeople,
};
```

### Dependencies updates

**We recommend to reformat your source code using the latest Prettier version**
(see below).

Here are some highlights of the main changes in upstream libraries that
_unlikely may_ impact your application. We have tested them and haven't found
any regression, but we prefer to mention these changes in case you detect a
weird issue after upgrading:

- `axios` does not append the `charset=utf-8` anymore for requests with
  `Content-Type:application/json`. See
  [#680](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/680#note_711807434),
  [#4016](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/4016) and
  [#2154](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/2154) and for details.
- `prettier` has been updated
  [from 2.2.1 to 2.4.1](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
  ([MR!742](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/742)).
  We've reformatted our code with this version, so it may lead to style
  differences with your overrides. To update your application code, you can run
  `npx prettier -w ./path/to/your/directories` and commit the changes.

:::tip ProTip™

we've discovered the
[git `ignoreRevsFile` option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt)
it could be useful
[in your project too](https://www.moxio.com/blog/43/ignoring-bulk-change-commits-with-git-blame)
😎

:::

### Unnecessary safeHtml in product overviews

The product overview component does not need to escape the product name with
`safeHtml`.

If you did override any of the following components, you can safely
[remove `safeHtml` calls](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/750)
in them:

- `src/web/theme/modules/ProductView/Overview/Overview.js`
- `theme-chocolatine/web/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/Overview/Overview.js`

```diff
- {<span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: safeHtml(name) }} />}
+ {name}
```

### New Magento `<WysiwygV2>` transforms may conflict with yours

In order to support Magento Page Builder's default content types, we have added
new components to the
[default `MagentoWysiwyg` transforms](/docs/advanced/theme/wysiwyg-platform#magentowysiwyg).

See
[the Page Builder ones](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/src/web/theme/modules/WysiwygV2/MagentoWysiwyg/PageBuilder/index.js)
and ensure there is no collision with your custom WYSIWYG components. While very
unlikely, it could be possible. For instance, if you may have overridden the
`theme/modules/WysiwygV2/MagentoWysiwyg/MagentoWysiwyg.js` to add a custom
`heading` component to the `componentsMap`.

### New features in `2.11.0`

These new features may be relevant for your existing application:

- [Magento2 B2B initial support](/docs/magento2/b2b) and
  [_Payment on account_ payment method support](/docs/advanced/payments/payment-on-account)
- [A quickorder module has been created to order by SKU](/docs/advanced/features/quickorder)
- Customer can now zoom in on product images in the product page
- [Magento Page Builder content](/docs/magento2/page-builder) is now supported
  for `MagentoWysiwyg` data. You can register new content types and extend our
  default ones.
- Front-Commerce dependencies are now regularly (and automatically) updated
  using [Depfu](https://depfu.com/). Patches are automatically applied if the CI
  is green, minor versions are manually approved. We always review changelogs
  provided by Depfu. **You can review updates any time
  [by filtering Merge Requests tagged `depfu`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=merged&label_name[]=depfu).**

## `2.9.0` -> `2.10.0`

### Magento1 MondialRelay module update

In this release we have added support for MondialRelay as a shipping method in
Magento2 based Front-Commerce implementation. As a result, we have changed the
way files are organized on the disk.

In a nutshell, the Front-Commerce module
`modules/shipping-mondialrelay-magento1` has been renamed to
`modules/shipping-mondialrelay` and this module was defining a GraphQL module
that has been renamed from `mondialrelay` to `magento1-mondialrelay`. So, if you
are upgrading a Magento1 based project using the MondialRelay module, you have
to update your `.front-commerce.js` as documented in
[the MondialRelay guide page](/docs/advanced/shipping/mondial-relay#integrate-with-magento1).
In addition, if you have custom code importing files from
`modules/shipping-mondialrelay-magento1`, you will also have to update those
imports to match the new file layout.

### Magento2 Adyen module update

In this release the Magento2 Adyen Front-Commerce module got a major revamp to
make it compatible with the latest Magento2 Adyen plugin (7.2). Several steps
are needed to upgrade your project if you are using this payment platform:

1. the Magento2 Adyen Front-Commerce module has been moved. As a result, you
   have to
   [update your `.front-commerce.js` as documented in the Adyen integration page](/docs/advanced/payments/adyen#register-the-adyen-for-magento2-payment-module-in-front-commerce).
1. the `FRONT_COMMERCE_ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY` environment variable is now required so
   you have
   [to configure the environment so that it is defined](/docs/advanced/payments/adyen#add-the-adyen-client-key-in-the-environment)
1. we have made some changes and fixes to
   [the Adyen related frontend components](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/2.10.0/modules/payment-adyen/web/theme/modules/Adyen).
   If you have overridden some of those, you have to backport the changes.

### Magento1 Payline module update

In this release, we've implemented automatic configuration for the Payline
environment from the related Magento setting. Payline will use the `HOMO` or
`PRODUCTION` environment based on what is configured in Magento.

If using Payline, you should update the Magento module to version
[1.3.0](https://github.com/front-commerce/magento1-module-payline-front-commerce/releases/tag/1.3.0).
If you don't, you will see the error below in your logs (and the `PRODUCTION`
environment will be used):

> ERROR on reorderForIds, the id payment/payline_common/environment has no
> associated result

### Configurable options HOC refactoring

**We highly recommend to test products configuration on the product and cart
pages after this migration.** Product configuration, bundle and custom options
selectors where homogeneized between these pages to fix some issues.

In this release we have done a refactor of the configurable product options. We
have extracted much of the logic from configurable product options from HOCs
into functions that can be used even outside of react.

This refactoring homogenized how options were used and allowed us to fix some
discrepancies between the product page and cart item update configurators.
Internal APIs were updated to cope with this change, and we deprecated some
legacy props.

#### CartItemOptionsUpdater needs `product` prop

`<CartItemOptionsUpdater>` now expects a `product` prop if you are using it you
should now send it the `product` as a prop like below:

```diff
-<CartItemOptionsUpdater {...props} />
+<CartItemOptionsUpdater product={product} {...props} />

#### ConfigurableOptions needs `selectedOptions` and deprecates `currentOptions`

`currentOptions` is deprecated in `<ConfigurableOptions>` (format
`{ optionLabel: valueLabel }`). `<ConfigurableOptions>` now expects
`selectedOptions` (format `{ optionId: valueId }` same as what
`useSelectedProductWithConfigurableOptions` returns)

```diff
-<ConfigurableOptions currentOptions={currentOptions} {...props} />
+<ConfigurableOptions selectedOptions={selectedOptions} {...props} />
```

#### New style sheet for `CartItemOptionsUpdater`

add the following line to `theme/modules/_modules.scss`

```scss
@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemOptionsUpdater/CartItemOptionsUpdater";
```

#### Import `hasCartItemOptions` from its own file in theme chocolatine

We refactored `hasCartItemOptions` from
`theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemOptions/CartItemOptions` to
`theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemOptions/hasCartItemOptions` so if you where
using it you need to change where you are importing if like below:

```diff
-import { hasCartItemOptions } from "theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemOptions/CartItemOptions";
+import hasCartItemOptions from "theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemOptions/hasCartItemOptions";
```

### SmartForms field internal changes

In this release, we've reworked the internals of SmartForm fields to better
support browser autocomplete.

The public API remains unchanged but if you've overriden internal components,
please check your overrides against their original. See these Merge Requests:
