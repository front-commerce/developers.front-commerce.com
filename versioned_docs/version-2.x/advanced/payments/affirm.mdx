There is only one way to accept payments with [Affirm](https://www.affirm.com/)
in your Front-Commerce application for now.

## Magento2 module

> _This feature has been added in versions: Front-Commerce `2.1.0`,
> Front-Commerce's Magento2 module `2.1.0`_

  This integration is aimed at being transparent for administrators and

Front-Commerce for Magento2 contains a `FrontCommerce_HeadlessAffirm` module
that turns the
[Affirm's official Magento extension](https://github.com/Affirm/Magento2_Affirm)
into a headless payment method for Front-Commerce. It is aimed at being
transparent for Magento administrators and developers while allowing for a
better Customer experience in a Front-Commerce application.

This integration is slightly different from
[traditional Magento2 headless payments](/docs/2.x/magento2/headless-payments)
in that sense that it contains a "companion component" in Front-Commerce. The
component allows to Authorize payments from the checkout page. No redirection to
Affirm is involved, the Customer remains on the Front-Commerce store.

Here is how to set this payment method up.

### Install and configure the `Astound_Affirm` Magento2 extension

Follow
[Affirm's documentation](https://docs.affirm.com/affirm-developers/docs/magento-2)
to install and configure the official Magento2 extension for Affirm payments.
You only need to follow steps `1.` and `2.` since other storefront features are
not relevant in a headless context.

You have to **configure the `Checkout Flow Type` to `Modal`** (instead of
`Redirect`).

### Enable the `FrontCommerce_HeadlessAffirm` Magento2 extension

Turn Affirm into a headless payment method by enabling Front-Commerce's
`HeadlessAffirm` module. No configuration is needed.

```shell
php bin/magento module:enable FrontCommerce_HeadlessAffirm
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
```

:::note

If the `FrontCommerce_HeadlessAffirm` is not detected by your Magento
installation, please ensure that you are using a Front-Commerce module version
`> 2.1.0`. Otherwise, you must first update your dependencies.

### Register the Affirm for Magento2 payment module in Front-Commerce

In your Front-Commerce application:

```diff title=".front-commerce.js"
   modules: [],
   serverModules: [
     { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
-    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" }
+    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
+    { name: "Magento2Affirm", path: "server/modules/payment-magento2-affirm" },
   ]
```

### Register your Affirm payment component

1. Override the file that lets you register additional payments forms in
   Front-Commerce

   ```shell
   mkdir -p my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/
   cp -u node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js
   ```

2. Register Affirm

   ```diff
   +import Affirm from "./Affirm";

   const ComponentMap = {
   +  affirm_gateway: Affirm,
   };
   ```

### Update your CSPs

To allow loading Affirm related remote resources:

```diff title="my-module/config/website.js"
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
-      scriptSrc: [],
-      frameSrc: [],
+      scriptSrc: ["*.affirm.com"],
+      frameSrc: ["*.affirm.com"],
      styleSrc: [],
      imgSrc: [],
-      connectSrc: [],
+      connectSrc: ["*.affirm.com"],
      baseUri: []
    }
  },
```

### That's it!

You can now configure the Magento extension to use a Sandbox mode and
[test the integration](https://docs.affirm.com/affirm-developers/docs/test-and-go-live)

:::note

Please keep in mind that Affirm is only available for US addresses and orders
placed in a store using the `USD` as main currency.
