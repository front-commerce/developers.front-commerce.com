As developers, we're no strangers to the crucial role configuration files play
in our applications. They serve as the backbone, defining the behavior and
structure of our systems. In this article, we'll dive into the transformative
journey of configuration files in Front-Commerce, making a big leap from v2 to
v3.

## Front-Commerce 2.x: Navigating the Configuration Maze

In Front-Commerce 2.x, configuring your application was not really as intuitive
as it was the result of several iterations over time. While the configuration
file played a central role, certain aspects raised concerns:

- **Unclear naming conventions**: The usage of names like webModules, modules,
  and serverModules in the configuration file introduced ambiguity, making it
  less intuitive for developers to discern their purposes.
- **Distributed configuration files**: Configuration settings were spread across
  various files in `src/config`, leading to a decentralized structure. This
  distribution added complexity, making it harder to manage and maintain a
  holistic view of the application's configuration.
- **Dynamic configuration needs**: Different modules necessitated separate
  configurations, extending beyond the main configuration files. This diversity
  in configuration areas, such as Content Security Policies (CSP) or having to
  install separated npm packages with specific versions, added an additional
  layer of intricacy for developers to navigate.
- **Overrides challenges**: Some "Extension components", such as
  `getAdditionalDataComponent` for Payment and Shipping methods, were designed
  specifically for to be overridden when installing modules.

Here's a snippet of how configuration file (**`front-commerce.js`**) looked like
in 2.x:

```jsx
module.exports = {
  name: "Front Commerce DEV",
  url: "http://www.front-commerce.test",
  modules: [
    "./modules/datasource-elasticsearch",
    "./theme-chocolatine",
    "./modules/front-commerce-b2b",
  ],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    {
      name: "Elasticsearch",
      path: "datasource-elasticsearch/server/modules/magento2-elasticsearch",
    },
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
    { name: "Magento2GraphQL", path: "server/modules/magento2-graphql" },
    { name: "Magento2Commerce", path: "server/modules/magento2-commerce" },
    { name: "Magento2B2B", path: "front-commerce-b2b/server/modules/magento2" },
  ],
  webModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "./src/web" },
    { name: "Theme Chocolatine", path: "./theme-chocolatine/web" },
    { name: "FrontCommerce B2B", path: "./modules/front-commerce-b2b/web" },
  ],
};
```

While it served its purpose, these challenges paved the way for a more
streamlined and user-friendly approach in subsequent versions.

## Front-Commerce 3.x: An unified, simplified configuration file

Fast forward to v3, and we've completely refactored how a Front-Commerce app
configuration was defined. The configuration is now made through a single file,
`front-commerce.config.js`, which includes all the necessary information for
running a Front-Commerce app. Let's break down the key enhancements.

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/config";
import themeChocolatine from "@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine";
import magento2 from "@front-commerce/magento2";
import adobeB2B from "@front-commerce/adobe-b2b";
import storesConfig from "./app/config/stores";
import cacheConfig from "./app/config/caching";
import appCSPProvider from "./app/config/cspProvider";

export default defineConfig({
  extensions: [themeChocolatine(), magento2(storesConfig), adobeB2B()],
  stores: storesConfig,
  cache: cacheConfig,
  configuration: {
    providers: [appCSPProvider()],
  },
  v2_compat: {
    useApolloClientQueries: true,
    useFormsy: true,
  },
  pwa: {
    appName: "Front-Commerce",
    shortName: "Front-Commerce",
    description: "My e-commerce application",
    themeColor: "#fbb03b",
    icon: "assets/icon.png",
    maskableIcon: "assets/icon.png",
  },
});
```

### Single Source of Truth

In contrast to v2, the v3 configuration file is now the single endpoint for all
things application-related. All extensions are registered through this file like
before, but it now also features the various configuration previously found in
`src/config/*.js` files, such as stores and caching configuration. This makes
using the configuration details much more reliable in the app.

### Typing with TypeScript

Leveling up the developer experience, the v3 configuration file is now fully
typed using TypeScript. Autocomplete and type checking bring a greater level of
clarity and confidence when writing your app’s configuration, while also giving
a quick sneak peek of each extension features and customizations.

### Extension API

As said above, v2’s “modules” have evolved into "extensions" in v3. Their
registration is now a eased through a simplified extension API
(`defineExtension()` and `defineRemixExtension()`) which streamlines the process
and makes your application more modular and extensible. Each extension can
directly define their own needs so that their usage is simplified in
`front-commerce.config.js`

This subject however deserves a whole article to be written about it
— \***\*stay tuned\*\*** 👀.

### Themes

Theme overrides, once defined via `webModules`, are now an integral part of the
configuration. Registering them becomes as straightforward as any other
extension, streamlining the overall architecture, and further reducing the main
configuration file responsibilities.

### No more use of `src/config/*.js`

V3 eliminates the need for separate configuration files (`src/config/*.js`) for
stores and caching. Previously, those files were imported and used by components
all over the codebase. Now, those are directly included in
`front-commerce.config.js`, promoting a cleaner and more organized setup. This
configuration is accessible through a shared “config” that is available in all
key location in the code.

## Embracing the change

The transition from V2 to V3 marks a paradigm shift in how we approach
configuration. With a consolidated and type-safe configuration file, we are
confident developers can embrace a more efficient and enjoyable development
experience. In upcoming version, further specific extension points will be added
to complete our “configuration arsenal”, and make it even better than before.
