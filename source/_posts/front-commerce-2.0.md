## Start quickly and iterate

Merchants want better conversion rates on mobile. Front-Commerce is an ally to achieve this goal in a timely fashion and reduce their <abbr title="Total Cost of Ownership">TCO</abbr>. It brings the best practices and technologies so teams can build a great shopping experience in weeks.

Start with our skeleton, configure it to connect to your backend (requires installing an extension for Magento platforms) and you have a fully-functional application in minutes. This starter is similar to our [online demonstrations](https://demo.front-commerce.com/). You can then iterate from it!

- convince your boss or a potential customer by building a <abbr title="Proof of Concept">PoC</abbr> in 1-day: [customize design tokens](/docs/essentials/adapt-theme-to-your-brand.html), override some key components…
- leverage [theme overrides](/docs/essentials/extend-the-theme.html) to share components and themes across stores or for seasonal branding
- with GraphQL modules, [combine GraphQL services](/docs/advanced/graphql/remote-schemas.html) and [extend the default schema](/docs/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema.html) to match your unique business domain
- deploy often (continuously?) your frontend without any impact on your backend

This is how Front-Commerce allows merchants to **go live in weeks, not months** or years!

## SEO and tracking by default

Front-Commerce [leverages Server Side Rendering (SSR)](/docs/advanced/theme/server-side-rendering.html) to ensure an optimal crawling by search engines. It supports redirections (including Magento URL rewrites), [sitemap generation](/docs/advanced/production-ready/sitemap.html) and a base theme with many schema.org metadata built-in.

Manage many trackings with ease thanks to Front-Commerce's helpers. With extensive events and page trackings in the base theme, you'll be able to track everything you want!

## Proven payment integrations

Payments are a sensitive part of any eCommerce store. Front-Commerce supports payment providers out of the box, to ensure that Customers will have a perfect payment journey.

There are different ways to integrate payments in your Front-Commerce checkout. It gives you some freedom to work with eCommerce platforms existing payment modules or going agnostic with [Front-Commerce Payments](/docs/advanced/payments/front-commerce-payments.html). Extensibility is also at the core of payment integrations, so you can customize how payments are done or implement your own payment provider.

## Platform agnostic

[Magento 1](/docs/magento1/overview.html) and [Magento 2](/docs/magento2/overview.html) stores have been running in production for years. Our GraphQL server allows you to keep the same frontend and enables **progressive migrations** use cases.

Front-Commerce support multi-store setups and can even allow merchants to use different backends for each one of them. Our Prismic and Wordpress integrations allows merchants to use modern CMS for their content.

We started supporting other platforms, and projects will go live in 2021 using them. Your feedback is important to us:

- [unified configurations](/docs/advanced/server/configurations.html) with modular configuration providers: a better developer experience and unlimited advanced patterns
- [develop in Storybook](/docs/essentials/add-component-to-storybook.html) with a sane set of defaults (including regression testing with Storyshots) to customize Front-Commerce's base theme easily and be productive.
