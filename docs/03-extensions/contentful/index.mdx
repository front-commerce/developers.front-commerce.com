## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Contentful extension, you need to have the following:

- Access to a [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) instance
- A working [Front-Commerce environment](/docs/3.x/get-started/installation)

To set up a Contentful instance, please refer to the
[Contentful documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/).

To set up a Front-Commerce environment, please refer to the
[Front-Commerce documentation](/docs/3.x/get-started/installation).

## Installation

To install the Contentful extension, run the following command:

```bash
$ pnpm install @front-commerce/contentful@latest
```

## Configuration

To use the Contentful extension, you need to configure your environment and your
Front-Commerce application.

### Environment variables

In the `.env` file, you need to define the following environment variables:

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`: The ID of your Contentful space
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: The access token for your Contentful
  space
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN`: The preview access token for
  your Contentful space

Optionally, you can also configure a different environment using
`FRONT_COMMERCE_CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=xxx`.

You can also explicitly override the locale used when retrieving Contentful
content by using the `FRONT_COMMERCE_CONTENTFUL_DANGEROUSLY_FORCED_LOCALE`
environment variable or with the contentful.locale configuration from a
[configuration provider](/docs/2.x/advanced/server/configurations#what-is-a-configuration-provider).
Please note however that this is not recommended by Front-Commerce.

### Front-Commerce application

To use the Contentful extension in your Front-Commerce application, you need to
register the extension in your `front-commerce.config.ts` file:

```ts title="front-commerce.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/config";
import themeChocolatine from "@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine";
import magento2 from "@front-commerce/magento2";
// add-next-line
import contentful from "@front-commerce/contentful";
import storesConfig from "./app/config/stores";
import cacheConfig from "./app/config/caching";

export default defineConfig({
  extensions: [
    magento2({ storesConfig }),
    themeChocolatine(),
    // add-next-line
    contentful(),
  ],
  stores: storesConfig,
  cache: cacheConfig,
  configuration: {
    providers: [],
  },
});
```
