Front-Commerce `1.0.0-beta.3` has been released with several improvements:
better embedded payment experience, customizable WYSIWYG components,
configurations override…

We also want to thank our partner [PH2M](https://www.ph2m.com) for their first
PRs, and [Webqam](https://www.webqam.fr) and [Occitech](https://www.occitech.fr)
for their contributions. This release is the first one with PR merged from
partners!

Two smaller bugfixes releases have been tagged since `1.0.0-beta.0` so that some
projects could move forward faster, but they did not contain any significant
changes.

## New features

Even though we are still in our `beta` releases, we don't want to slow down our
customers and keep on adding the features they need.

### Improved embedded payments

In previous versions, embedded payments such as Stripe or Payzen needed two
clicks for placing an order: one to validate the payment's information, and
another to place the order. We have improved this behavior and the user now only
needs to submit its payment, and this will place the order directly in one
click.

We also upgraded Stripe and Payzen to their latest versions to make sure that
your customers have the best payment experience.

Finally, Stripe integration has been improved to create Stripe Customers
entities upon payments so merchants could identify them more easily. We also
introduced ways to customize the data sent to Stripe so developers could add any
additional metadata to Stripe Customers and PaymentIntents entities (each
project may have its own requirements).

### Highly customizable Wysiwyg components

Nowadays, merchants need to contribute their content in an attractive way. They
can't just add walls of text. This is why in Front-Commerce we have a `Wysiwyg`
component that lets you parse the content of your backoffice and transforms it
in a React component. This gives you all the freedom you need to contribute
interactive content.

However, this component was a bit tough to customize in its previous versions.
So we have revamped its API to make sure that you can customize it as much as
you want. See [WYSIWYG documentation](/docs/2.x/advanced/theme/wysiwyg) for more
details.

This was also an opportunity to support a wider range of Magento's features. For
instance, we now support
[Widgets](https://www.toptal.com/magento/custom-widgets-in-magento-2) in
Magento. Any contributed widget will be parsed and then render a React component
that you can customize depending on your needs. See
[Magento's WYSIWYG supported features](/docs/2.x/advanced/theme/wysiwyg/legacy#magento-thememoduleswysiwygmagentowysiwyg)
for more details.

### Load configuration files from parent modules

[Custom themes](/docs/2.x/essentials/extend-the-theme) defined in the
[`modules` key of your `.front-commerce.js` file](/docs/2.x/reference/front-commerce-js#modules)
will now inherits configuration files from parent themes.

Before this change, all config files had to be defined in the latest module. It
was not very convenient for extension providers or short-lived themes (sales,
Black Friday…) extending your default theme.

Example of what now works:

```js
// .front-commerce.js
module.exports = {
  name: "ACME Store",
  url: "http://www.acme.test",
  modules: ["./src", "./christmas"],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
  ],
};
```

File structure

```text
src
├── config
│   ├── analytics.js
│   ├── autocomplete.js
│   ├── caching.js
│   ├── stores.js
│   ├── website.js

```

### And more minor features

And a few more features such as:

- Auto redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS in production mode
  ([see more details](/docs/2.x/appendices/migration-guides/archives/#https))
- Improved schema stitching from developers feedbacks to allow custom headers
  and authenticated requests
  ([see more details](/docs/2.x/advanced/graphql/remote-schemas#customize-remote-http-requests))
- Expose a product's short description in the GraphQL schema

## Bugfixes

We also made a few bugfixes such as:

- Fix display of order statuses in a user's account
- Fix coupon deletion from cart
- Fix stories detection when using multiple modules

## Magento1 support in progress

We have also worked on the Magento1 integration, and things are taking shape.
The first projects have been started and we plan to merge the feature branch in
`master` in the next release.

An online demo will also be deployed so you could have a look at a real
instance!
