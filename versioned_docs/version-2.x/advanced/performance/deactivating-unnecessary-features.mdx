title: Deactivating unnecessary features
description:
  Front-Commerce contains several features enabled by default to provide a good
  experience out of the box. Deactivating features you don't need can make your
  application faster.

Each production context is different: projects may not need some features or the
infrastructure may have other components that provides the same feature in a
more performant way. In these contexts, we recommend that you deactivate
Front-Commerce built-in features to prevent unnecessary processing and improve
your application's performance.

This page contains a list of features that can be deactivated when not relevant
to your context.

## Deactivate response compression

You can deactivate response compression (e.g: `gzip`) from the Front-Commerce
server. It allows to reduce your server CPU usage in contexts where a frontend
CDN or proxy can handle compression more efficiently.

If your application is deployed in such context, you might consider deactivating
it. There are two ways to achieve this:

- globally: set the `FRONT_COMMERCE_EXPRESS_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=false`
  environment variable and no response will be compressed
- per request: add the `x-no-compression` request header to prevent compressing
  specific requests
