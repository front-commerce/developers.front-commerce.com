# Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA)

Front-Commerce provides a base platform-agnostic module to support RMA. We also
ship some platform-specific implementations for RMA. For now, Magento1EE and
[Magento2 Commerce](/docs/magento2/commerce#rma) are supported.

It is up to the integrator to either use one of our provided implementations or
extend our base RMA module to add functionality to the specific platform.

## Front-Commerce base RMA module

The base RMA module is located at `src/server/modules/front-commerce/rma` it
contains the basic GraphQL schema and empty resolver implementation. This module
is all you need to know what is required to implement an RMA module that
supports your platform.

## The frontend implementation

The frontend implementation of the RMA is shipped with the Front Commerce
themes. You can have a look at its implementation in
`src/web/theme/pages/Account/Orders/Details/ReturnForm` should you need to
override its behaviour.

## Implementing an RMA that suits you

To implement an RMA for a new platform, you have to provide the server
implementation of the Graph. Having a look at Front-Commerce's implementation
for Magento1 Enterprise RMA (`src/server/modules/magento1ee/rma`) should help
give you some guidance. Here is a short summary of what is needed:

### Extending necessary GraphQL enums

1. Extend the `ReturnMerchandiseAuthorizationStatus` enum with all the possible
   statuses that an RMA could have.
2. Extend the `ReturnedItemStatus` enum with all the possible statuses a
   returned item can have.

### Providing necessary resolver functions

1. implement the `createReturnMerchandizeAuthorizationRequest` mutation. The
   `createReturnMerchandizeAuthorizationRequest` mutation will receive a
   variable called `input` of type
   `CreateReturnMerchandizeAuthorizationRequestInput` and returns a
   `CreateReturnMerchandizeAuthorizationOutput` which is a
   `MutationSuccessInterface` with an extra `order` field representing the
   current order.
1. implement the field `returns` of the type `Order`. This field should return
   all returned items belonging to this order. (please note that a `return`
   object has `items` fields this is due to the fact that some products have
   bundled items and it is sometimes possible to return some of those items).
1. implement `isReturnable` field of the type `Order`. This should return true
   in case the order has returnable items.
1. implement `isReturnable` field of the type `OrderItem`. This should return
   true in case the item is returnable.
1. implement `returnAttributes` field of the type `OrderItem`. Note: a
   `returnAttribute`'s type is the interface `ReturnAttribute` it is up to the
   integrator to resolve the `returnAttribute`'s type.
1. implement `returns` field of the type `Customer` this should return all
   returns belonging to the parent customer.

## The create RMA page

We ship a page that is used to create an RMA. The link to this page will show up
in the order details page after you have implemented resolvers related to RMA.
