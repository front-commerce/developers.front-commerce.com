title: Translate your application
description:
  International e-commerce websites often need to translate their UI into
  several languages to make sure that they reach a broader range of customers.
  This documentation will show how this works for static content in your
  application.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

:::note

If you want to configure your application to support multiple languages, please
refer to
[Configure multiple stores](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/2.x/advanced/production-ready/multistore).

:::

Front-Commerce manages your translations by using
[react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/application-workflow), a
standard library in the React ecosystem. This library works by transforming your
static values in React Components. These components will then fetch your
translations and display them in your application.

## Declare translations in your application

:::info

You can find the full set of components in the
[React Intl Components documentation](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/components/).

:::

For instance, let's see how to transform your values in `react-intl` Components.

### Strings

```tsx
import { FormattedMessage } from "react-intl";

<FormattedMessage
  id="My.Component.Id.messageId"
  defaultMessage="Default translation"
/>;
```

:::note

To take full advantage of the `translate` cli in Front-Commerce, a default
message is required for formatted messages. This will be used to extract the
messages for the default locale and ensure there are no dead translations, or
missing translations.

:::

### Dates

```tsx
import { FormattedDate } from "react-intl";

<FormattedDate value={date} year="numeric" month="long" day="2-digit" />;
```

### Prices

```tsx
import { FormattedNumber } from "react-intl";

<FormattedNumber
  value={value.amount}
  style="currency"
  currency={value.currency}
/>;
```

:::note

However, for this particular use case we have abstracted this in Front-Commerce
with the
[theme/components/atoms/Price](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/components/atoms/Typography/Price/index.js)
component (and its variants: `ProductPrice`, `PriceOrFree`). We recommend you to
use it instead, so you could benefit from better integration with its related
GraphQL Type.

:::

### Without React Component

These components will be enough in most cases. However, the issue with these is
that it wraps your string within a React Element, which may be troublesome when
you actually need to handle the string itself.

For instance, this is the case when you want to add some label attributes to
your <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> elements.

```jsx
<span class="icon" aria-label="Icon title displayed for screen readers" />
```

Fortunately, this is correctly handled by `react-intl` if you use
[`defineMessages`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/api/#definemessagesdefinemessage)
combined with the
[`useIntl`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/api/#useintl-hook) hook or the
[`injectIntl`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/upgrade-guide-3x/#new-useintl-hook-as-an-alternative-of-injectintl-hoc)
HOC.

```jsx
import { defineMessages, useIntl } from "react-intl";

const messages = defineMessages({
  ariaLabel: {
    id: "screen-reader-icon-title",
    defaultMessage: "Icon title displayed for screen readers",
  },
});

const MyComponentWithHook = (props) => {
  const intl = useIntl();
  return (
    <span class="icon" aria-label={intl.formatMessage(messages.ariaLabel)} />
  );
};
```

:::caution IMPORTANT

You should always define a `defaultMessage`, and preferably in your default
locale which you will use with the `translate` command. This will allow
`FormatJS` to extract the existing messages for your application.

:::

## Translate what's in your components

Now that you have defined what should be translated in your application, you
actually need to translate your application. This is a two-step process:

1. Run the following script that will fetch all your translatable strings in
   your application and gather them in a JSON file located in
   `translations/[locale].json`

   ```shell
   $ front-commerce translate <path> --locale <locale>
   ```

   :::tip ProTipâ„¢

   The script has already been defined in the
   [skeleton template](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/skeleton/package.json?ref_type=heads#L13),
   and can be used directly with `pnpm run translate`. You can change the
   default locale to accommodate your store.

   :::

2. Translate the strings available in those files, and you are good to go ðŸ™‚

   If your default locale is `en` and you want to add support for `fr` you can
   create a `fr.json` in your `translations` folder and translate the strings
   for each key.

   :::tip ProTipâ„¢

   You can use tools like [BabelEdit](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit) to
   help translate and keep your translations in sync.

   :::

### Translations fallback

With `react-intl` translations are usually grouped into a single file. In our
case, we would expect them to be in `translations/[locale].json`. but we don't
want you to be troubled by translations that are handled by the core.

That's why Front-Commerce uses a mechanism called **translations fallbacks**.
Instead of relying on a single file for translations, Front-Commerce will look
out for translations that are defined by extensions

#### From your extension [declared in `front-commerce.config.js`](/docs/remixed/guides/register-an-extension)

If you are developing an extension, you will need to add the path to your
translations in the extension configuration file, for example lets say your
translations are located in `<my-extension>/translations/[locale].json`.

You can then run the following command command to extract the translations from
your extension:

```bash
$ pnpm run front-commerce translate <my-extension>/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx} --locale <locale>
```

And then in your extension definition file you should add the `translations`
option:

```ts title="<my-extension>/index.ts"
import { defineExtension } from "@front-commerce/core";

export default defineExtension({
  // ...
  translations: `${__dirname}/translations`, // path to your translations
});
```

This will extract the translations in your extension to the following file:

- `<my-extension>/translations/<locale>.json`

It will also allow it to be injected into the generated translation file.

#### From your project

- `lang/[short-locale].json` or
- `lang/[locale].json`

`[short-locale]` here means that we are only taking the first particle of the
`locale`. E.g. if the locale was `en-GB`, the short-locale would be `en`. That's
how `en-GB` would load translations from both `en.json` and `en-GB.json` files.

If a translation key is defined in multiple files, the last one (according to
the above list) will be be used. This is especially useful if you want to change
the core's translations.

:::tip ProTipâ„¢

You can see exactly which translation files are used by opening the files
located in .front-commerce/compiled-lang/.

:::

With `react-intl` translations are usually grouped into a single file. In our
case, we would expect them to be in `lang/[locale].json`, we don't want you to
be troubled by translations that are handled by the core.

Please keep in mind that when you run `pnpm run translate`, new keys will be
added to `lang/[locale].json` as the script only detects locales in the `app`
folder.

## About dynamic content

`react-intl` lets you translate your static content. But what about dynamic
content? Things like product title and description, CMS pages, etc.

This is done on the GraphQL side. The principle is that when a user is connected
to Front-Commerce, they will be assigned a `storeViewCode` in their session (see
[Configure multiple stores](/docs/2.x/advanced/production-ready/multistore) for
more details).

This code will then be used by your GraphQL loaders to retrieve the correct
content from your backend. Learn more about
[GraphQL loaders](/docs/2.x/advanced/graphql/slim-down-resolvers-with-loaders).

## Loaders and Meta function

The
[`FrontCommerceApp`](/docs/remixed/api-reference/front-commerce-remix/front-commerce-app)
instance exposes the [`intl` object](https://formatjs.io/docs/intl) which can be
used to translate strings in your loaders, which can then be used in in the meta
function.

```tsx title="app/routes/my-route.ts"
import { json } from "@front-commerce/remix/node";
import type { LoaderFunctionArgs, MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";
import { FrontCommerceApp } from "@front-commerce/remix";
import { defineMessage } from "react-intl";

const documentTitle = defineMessage({
  id: "pages.my-route.document-title",
  defaultMessage: "My Route",
});

export const loader = async ({ context }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const app = new FrontCommerceApp(context.frontCommerce);

  return json({
    // highlight-next-line
    title: app.intl.formatMessage(messages.documentTitle),
  });
};

export const meta: MetaFunction = (args) => {
  // This will contain the translated title returned from the loader function.
  // highlight-next-line
  return [{ title: args.data.title }];
};
```
