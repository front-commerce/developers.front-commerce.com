Front Commerce supports external logins. The API for supporting external logins
comes in 2 parts:

- The `LoginProvider` which implements the login with the external systems (such
  as Facebook or Google)
- The `ExternalLoginHandler` which implements the login with your platform (such
  as Magento1, Magento2, Proximis or BigCommerce).

Out of the box we ship two `LoginProvider`s -the `FacebookProvider` and the
`GoogleProvider`- and two `ExternalLoginHandler`s -the
`Magento1ExternalLoginHandler` and the `Magento2ExternalLoginHandler`.

## The User

The user object in the context of external logins is an object with the
following signature:

```json
{
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

We recommend the use of the class
`./modules/auth-external-login/server/domain/ExternalLoginUser.js` while
customizing external logins.

## Adding the necessary modules

To enable external logins you need to add the `auth-external-login` and the
external login handler for your platform (example below adds
`Magento2ExternalLoginHandler`) to your modules in the `.front-commerce.js`
file:

```js title="./front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  name: "Front Commerce DEV",
  url: "http://www.front-commerce.test",
  modules: [
    "./node_modules/front-commerce/theme-chocolatine",
    // highlight-start
    "./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/auth-external-login",
    "./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/auth-external-login-magento2",
    // highlight-end
  ],
};
```

## Magento1 Requirements

For the external logins to work with the Magento1 module in addition to
[Adding the necessary modules](#adding-the-necessary-modules) you need to ensure
you have the Magento1 connector on 1.4.2 or later.

## Magento2 Requirements

For the external logins to work with the Magento2 module in addition to
[Adding the necessary modules](#adding-the-necessary-modules) you need to ensure
you are have the Magento2 connector on 2.6.0 or later.

## Ensuring the login buttons show

The `auth-external-login` registered above added two components to the
`LoginForm` component : `AdditionalLoginFormActions` and `FlashMessages` in
2.13.0.

If you overrode `LoginForm` please refer to the
[migration guides](/docs/appendices/migration-guides#login-form-update) for more
details

After ensuring that `AdditionalLoginFormActions` and `FlashMessages` are in your
`LoginForm` the "Sign in with Facebook" and "Sign in with Google" buttons should
now appear in your login page/modal.

## Adding the stylesheet

For the out of the box login buttons you can include the following stylesheet in
your `main.scss` file:

```scss
@import "~theme/modules/modules";
@import "~theme/pages/pages";
// highlight-next-line
@import "~theme/external-login.scss";
```

## Configuring the buttons

To configure the buttons shown for external logins you can override the
`theme/modules/User/LoginForm/AdditionalLoginFormActions/AdditionalLoginFormActions.js`
file and add or remove the buttons you want.

## Configuring the Facebook provider

The `FacebookProvider` needs the `clientId` and the `clientSecret` to work. You
can get these from your app on the
[Facebook developer console](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).

To configure the `clientId` and the `clientSecret` you need to define the
following environment variables:

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` for the `clientId`
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET` for the `clientSecret`

### Configuring Redirect URIs

You need to configure the allowed redirect URIs on your
[Facebook developer console](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). Note that
the `Valid OAuth Redirect URIs` should contain all your stores URLs followed by
`/external-login/facebook/callback`.

For example if you have two stores `https://example.com/en` and
`https://example.com/fr`, you need to put
`https://example.com/en/external-login/facebook/callback` and
`https://example.com/fr/external-login/facebook/callback` in the
`Valid OAuth Redirect URIs` field.

### Working with the Facebook provider in development mode (localhost)

External login rely on redirections, and in development your server is usually
at `http://localhost` i.e. not reachable to Facebook. So to circumvent this in
development mode you can use a proxying service such as
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to proxy requests to your local machine. A proxying
service will provide a publicly accessible URL to your local server. So to work
with Facebook external logins on your local machine you need to set the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_FACEBOOK_DEVELOPMENT_BASE_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable to
the URL given to you by your proxying service. (p.s. use just the origin part of
the url without any trailing slashes `/`).

_Note: do not forget to [reconfigure your app](#configuring-redirect-uris) with
this new URL_

## Configuring the Google provider

The `GoogleProvider` needs the `clientId` and the `clientSecret` to work. You
can get these from your "OAuth2.0 Client" of your app on the
[google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
P.S. you need to create one if you have not already.

To configure the `clientId` and the `clientSecret` you need to define the
following environment variables:

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` for the `clientId`
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` for the `clientSecret`

### Configuring Redirect URIs

You need to configure the allowed redirect URIs under your "OAuth2.0 Client" of
your app on the
[Google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
Note that the `Authorized redirect URIs` should contain all your stores URLs
followed by `/external-login/google/callback`.

For example if you have two stores `https://example.com/en` and
`https://example.com/fr`, you need to put
`https://example.com/en/external-login/google/callback` and
`https://example.com/fr/external-login/google/callback` in the
`Valid OAuth Redirect URIs` field.

### Working with the Google provider in development mode

Please refer to
[Working with the Facebook provider in development mode](#working-with-the-facebook-provider-in-development-mode-localhost)
above for more details. The only difference is that the environment variable you
need to set its `FRONT_COMMERCE_GOOGLE_DEVELOPMENT_BASE_CALLBACK_URL`.
