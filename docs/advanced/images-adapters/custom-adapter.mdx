### What is an Image Adapter?

An Image Adapter is a custom function that you can use to deliver images
enhanced and optimized for every user. It is a function that takes an image URL
as input and returns a new image URL as output. The new image URL can be the
same as the original image URL, or it can be a different image URL that is
optimized for the user's device, browser, or network.

### Getting Started

To get started, you need to create a custom adapter class. The class must extend
the `ImageAdapter` domain which implements a `supportSrc` method, and a
`makeImageSrc` method.

The `supportSrc` method is used to check if the image URL is valid for the
current adapter. If the image URL is valid, the `makeImageSrc` method is called
to generate the new image URL.

### Creating an Image Adapter

So for example, if we have two Image Adapters, one for images from the Unsplash,

```js title="src/web/adapters/unsplash.js"
import { ImageAdapter } from "theme/components/atoms/Image/ImageAdapter";

class UnsplashAdapter extends ImageAdapter {
  supportSrc(src) {
    return src.includes("unsplash.com");
  }

  makeImageSrc(src) {
    // ... do something with the image URL
    return src;
  }
}

export default new UnsplashAdapter();
```

and one for images from the Lorem Picsum, we can create the following classes:

```js title="src/web/adapters/lorem-picsum.js"
import { ImageAdapter } from "theme/components/atoms/Image/ImageAdapter";

class LoremPicsumAdapter extends ImageAdapter {
  supportSrc(src) {
    return src.includes("picsum.photos");
  }

  makeImageSrc(src) {
    // ... do something with the image URL
    return src;
  }
}

export default new LoremPicsumAdapter();
```

### Registering an Image Adapter

To register an Image Adapter, you need to add it to the `imageAdapters`
component you can do this by adding it to a top level route or a layout for
example.

```js title="src/web/routes/Home/Home.js"
import imageAdapters from "theme/components/atoms/Image/adapters";

import UnsplashAdapter from "src/web/adapters/unsplash";
import LoremPicsumAdapter from "src/web/adapters/lorem-picsum";

imageAdapters.register(UnsplashAdapter);
imageAdapters.register(LoremPicsumAdapter);
```

### Using an Image Adapter

All the built-in image components use the ImageAdapters by default to deliver
images enhanced and optimized images.
