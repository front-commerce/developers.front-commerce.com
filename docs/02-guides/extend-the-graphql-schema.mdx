When developing an e-commerce store, you might at some point need to expose new
data in your unified GraphQL schema to support new features and allow frontend
developers to use them. Front-Commerce’s GraphQL modules is the mechanism
allowing to extend and override any part of the schema defined by other modules.

The Front-Commerce core and platform integrations (such as Magento2) are
implemented as GraphQL modules. They leverage features from the GraphQL Schema
Definition Language (<abbr title="Schema Definition Language">SDL</abbr>).

This page will guide you through the process of exposing a new feature in your
GraphQL schema. We will create an extension with a GraphQL module that allows to
maintain a counter of clicks for a product.

## Create an extension

To extend the GraphQL schema and implement your own logic, you first have to
create an extension. An extension can be created by adding a new folder under
`extensions` and by creating a `index.ts` file (the extension definition) with
the following content:

```typescript title="example-extensions/click-counter/index.ts"
import { defineExtension } from "@front-commerce/core";

export default function clickCounter() {
  return defineExtension({
    name: "click-counter",
    configuration: {
      providers: [],
    },
  });
}
```

Then you need to
[register the extension into your Front-Commerce project](/docs/3.x/guides/register-an-extension).

## Add a GraphQL module within the extension

For now, the `click-counter` extension does not provide any feature. To extend
the GraphQL schema and implement our own logic, we need to add a GraphQL module
to the extension containing a schema and some resolvers.

### Add an empty GraphQL module

For that, you can create the GraphQL module definition in the file
`example-extensions/click-counter/graphql/index.ts` with the following content:

```typescript title="example-extensions/click-counter/graphql/index.ts"
export default {
  namespace: "ClickCounter",
};
```

This is a minimal GraphQL module definition which namespace is `ClickCounter`
and that does nothing for now.

Then, the extension needs to declare that it provides a GraphQL module by
modifying the extension's index.ts:

```typescript title="Changes to example-extensions/click-counter/index.ts"
import { defineExtension } from "@front-commerce/core";

export default function clickCounter() {
  return defineExtension({
    name: "click-counter",
    configuration: {
      providers: [],
    },
    // highlight-start
    graphql: {
      unstable_module: "./example-extensions/click-counter/graphql",
    },
    // highlight-end
  });
}
```

At this point, your Front-Commerce project is configured with an extension
called `click-counter`, this extension provides a GraphQL module which namespace
is `Clickcounter`. The extension is now ready to bring changes to your Graph.

### Extend the Graph

Front-Commerce lets you describe your schema using the expressive
[GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#type-language).

We would like to:

1. add a `clickCounter` field to the existing `Product` type
2. add an `incrementProductCounter` mutation

For that, you can create the file `extension/click-counter/graphql/schema.gql`:

```graphql title="extension/click-counter/graphql/schema.gql"
extend type Product {
  clickCounter: Int
}

extend type Mutation {
  incrementProductCounter(sku: String!, incrementValue: Int): MutationSuccess!
}
```

:::info

The `Product` type is part of Front-Commerce’s `Front-Commerce/Product` module.
The `MutationSuccess` type, used as the response for the mutation, is part of
Front-Commerce’s core.

:::

For that file to be taken into account, the extension needs to declare that it
provides one or several schema file by modifying the
`extension/click-counter/index.ts`:

```typescript title="Changes to example-extensions/click-counter/index.ts"
import { defineExtension } from "@front-commerce/core";

export default function clickCounter() {
  return defineExtension({
    name: "click-counter",
    configuration: {
      providers: [],
    },
    graphql: {
      // highlight-next-line
      schema: ["./example-extensions/click-counter/graphql/schema.gql"],
      unstable_module: "./example-extensions/click-counter/graphql",
    },
  });
}
```

:::tip

The `schema` can also be a be a globby pattern, for instance
`./example-extensions/click-counter/graphql/*.gql`.

:::

At this point, after restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able to see in the
GraphQL playground `http://localhost:4000/graphql` that the type `Product` has a
`clickCounter` field and that a mutation `incrementProductCounter` exists.

You can try to execute the query below in your GraphQL playground
`http://localhost:4000/graphql`:

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000/graphql"
{
  product(sku: "WH09") {
    sku
    clickCounter
  }
}
```

Our GraphQL module does not yet have any code for sending content. This means
that even if you can request the `clickCounter` field, it won't actually return
any data. So you should see the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "product": {
      "sku": "WH09",
      "clickCounter": null
    }
  }
}
```

### Implement the logic

The latest step is to implement the logic to retrieve the `Product.clickCounter`
value and behind the `incrementProductCounter` mutation. For that, you have to
add resolvers for the field and the mutation. This is where most of the _real
work_ is done, for instance by fetching remote data sources or transforming
data.

Resolvers are exposed using the `resolvers` key of the GraphQL module
definition. It should be a
[**Resolver map**](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/resolvers): an object
where each key is a GraphQL type name, and values are mapping between field
names and resolver function. Resolver functions may return a
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)
for asynchronous operations.

:::note

To learn more about resolvers and their internals, we recommend reading
[GraphQL Tools resolvers documentation](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/resolvers).

:::

First, let's update the module definition as follow:

```typescript title="Changes to example-extensions/click-counter/graphql/index.ts"
// highlight-next-line
import resolvers from "./resolvers";

export default {
  namespace: "ClickCounter",
  // highlight-next-line
  resolvers,
};
```

And then create the `resolvers.ts` file with a resolver map as below:

```typescript title="example-extensions/click-counter/graphql/resolvers.ts"
export default {
  Product: {
    clickCounter: (product) => {
      console.log(`click count retrieval for product ${product.sku}`);
      // your own retrieval logic here
      return 1;
    },
  },

  Mutation: {
    incrementProductCounter: (_root, params) => {
      const { sku, incrementValue } = params;
      console.log(`incrementing counter for product "${sku}"`);
      console.log(`counter + ${incrementValue ?? 1}`);
      // your own increment logic here
      return {
        success: true,
      };
    },
  },
};
```

It brings a very basic implementation for both the `Product.clickCounter` field
resolution and the `incrementProductCounter` mutation. After restarting
Front-Commerce, the `clickCounter` field of a product should now return `1`
instead of `null`. Likewise, the mutation can also be called from the
playground.

As stated above, a resolver function can also return a Promise and thus handle
asynchronous result. A more real life resolver map would like look like:

```typescript title="example-extensions/click-counter/graphql/resolvers.ts"
export default {
  Product: {
    clickCounter: (product) => {
      const clickCountPromise = fetchClickCountForSku(product.sku);
      return clickCountPromise;
    },
  },

  Mutation: {
    incrementProductCounter: async (_root, params) => {
      const { sku, incrementValue } = params;
      try {
        await incrementProductCount(sku, incrementValue);
        return {
          success: true,
        }
      } catch (error)
        return {
          success: false,
          errorMessage: error.message,
        };
      };
    },
  },
};
```
