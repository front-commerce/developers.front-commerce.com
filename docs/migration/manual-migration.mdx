This manual migration process should be run after the
[automated migration process](./automated-migration), to complete the missing
parts, or debug issues in the migration CLI output.

## Sass Migration

In the latest version of Front-Commerce we converted all Sass variables to CSS
variables during the [automated migration](./automated-migration). This allows
for a more modular approach to theming and a better developer experience.
However, there are still some manual steps that need to be taken to complete the
migration.

### Media Mixin

If you make use of the
[`media-breakpoint-up`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/01f9c95003f7d4204acd12264c3375464e6c3a12/theme-chocolatine/web/theme/components/atoms/Breakpoints/_breakpoints.scss#L23-34)
mixin, you will need to directly import the
[\_breakpoints.scss](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/01f9c95003f7d4204acd12264c3375464e6c3a12/theme-chocolatine/web/theme/components/atoms/Breakpoints/_breakpoints.scss)
file at the location where it is used.

If you have the following example component:

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Example/Example.scss"
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
  .Example {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

You would need to import the `_breakpoints.scss` directly in the `Example.scss`
file

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Example/Example.scss"
// add-next-line
@import "theme/components/atoms/Breakpoints/breakpoints";

@include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
  .Example {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

### Color functions

If you use any Sass
[color functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color) you will
need to directly import the
[color.scss](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/01f9c95003f7d4204acd12264c3375464e6c3a12/theme-chocolatine/web/theme/components/atoms/Colors/_colors.scss)
file at the location where it is used. This is because Sass can not process the
functions on CSS variables.

If you have the following example component:

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Example/Example.scss"
.Example {
  color: darken(var(--colorPrimary), 10%);
}
```

You would need to import the `color.scss` directly in the `Example.scss` file

```scss title="theme/components/atoms/Example/Example.scss"
// add-next-line
@import "theme/components/atoms/Colors/colors";

.Example {
  // remove-next-line
  color: darken(var(--colorPrimary), 10%);
  // add-next-line
  color: darken($colorPrimary, 10%);
}
```
