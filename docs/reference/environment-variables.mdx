title: Environment variables
description:
  "Environment variables available in Front-Commerce are the configurations that
  are likely to change depending on the current environment of your application.
  For instance, you could have three different environments: production,
  staging, and local."

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

import ContactLink from "@site/src/components/ContactLink";

Environment variables documented in this guide can be defined in two different
ways:

- on your server (See
  [How To Read and Set Environmental and Shell Variables on a Linux VPS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-a-linux-vps))
- in the `.env` file in your root folder

You can then access them by using the `process.env` object in your javascript
files no matter if it is a server-side or client-side file. However, not all
variables are exposed in your client code. Client code only have access to
variables such as `FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_*` which were defined during
`front-commerce build`. See
[Add your own environment variables](/docs/reference/environment-variables#Add-your-own-environment-variables)
for more details.

## How to update environment variables

You can't update these variables only by updating your server's variable. This
comes from how node works. But there are also some specificities due to
Front-Commerce.

- If `FRONT_COMMERCE_USE_SERVER_DYNAMIC_ENV=true` during build time:
  - ðŸš« if the variable is used on the client side (`FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_*`) you
    need to do a new `front-commerce build`
  - âœ… if the variable is only used on the server side (`FRONT_COMMERCE_*` but
    not `FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_*`) you only need to restart your server
- If `FRONT_COMMERCE_USE_SERVER_DYNAMIC_ENV=false` during build time (default
  behavior until 1.0.0):
  - ðŸš« You need to do a new `front-commerce build` and restart your server

The reason behind these rules is because some variables are defined and bundled
within your code during the `build` of your application. For this reason, if you
are are in a case where you can't update the variable, you will need to trigger
a new build with the new environment variables defined and restart your server.

## Front-Commerce related variables

### Host

Configure the execution environment of the Front-Commerce's application:

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_PORT` (default: `4000`): The port of the launched server
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_HOST` (default: `0.0.0.0`): The host of the launched server.
  It might be useful to set it to `127.0.0.1` if you want to only listen local
  requests.
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_URL`: The URL available to access to your Front-Commerce
  application (http://localhost:4000 in your local environment, and your website
  URL on the production environment)
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_ENV`: `dev` or `production` in order to remove debugging
  options on the server side (ex: we disable GraphQL playground in production
  mode)
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_COOKIE_DOMAIN` _(deprecated)_: the domain of your cookie, most
  likely the same one used in `FRONT_COMMERCE_URL` (ex: localhost or the your
  domain name). Deprecation reason: the cookie domain will now be defined
  automatically by the browser.
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_COOKIE_PASS`: a secret to secure the cookies exchanged with
  the client
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_UNSAFE_INSECURE_MODE`: you set this environment variable to
  `true` to disable Front-Commerce behaviors restricting HTTP usage in
  production, even though we strongly recommend you to expose your application
  through HTTPS.

:::note

In production, Front-Commerce will use the
[`secure` mode for setting cookies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session#cookiesecure)
to force running the application in HTTPS. If your production instance is not in
HTTPS, you will encounter issues when logging in. That is why Front-Commerce
redirects user to the HTTPS version of a page in this case. Use the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_UNSAFE_INSECURE_MODE` documented above sparingly.

:::

### Cache

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_CACHE_API_TOKEN`: a token that will let external applications
  invalidate parts of Front-Commerce cache. See
  [Invalidating the cache](/docs/advanced/graphql/dataloaders-and-cache-invalidation#Invalidating-the-cache)
  for more details.

### Performance

- ~~`FRONT_COMMERCE_FAST`: by setting it to `true`, there will be only one
  render to fetch data server side. cf.
  [Faster Server Side Rendering](/docs/advanced/performance/faster-server-side-rendering)
  for more details.~~ Removed in version 2.7. Please use
  [Cache-Control headers](/docs/advanced/performance/cache-control-and-cdn) to
  improve performance of SSR pages.
- `ENGINE_API_KEY`: set it to enable
  [Metrics & Logging](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/monitoring/metrics/#sending-metrics-to-apollo-graph-manager)
  on your GraphQL schema, using Apollo Engine
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_EXPRESS_COMPRESSION_ENABLED`: set it to `false` to disable
  server responses compression. It allows to reduce your server CPU usage in
  contexts where a frontend CDN or proxy can handle compression more
  efficiently. It can also be disable per request, if the request contains the
  `x-no-compression` header.

### Server

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_EXPRESS_LOG_ACCESS_ENABLED`: in some contexts, the proxy
  already has access logs and it is not useful to have a duplication. Logs grow
  unnecessarily and it adds an overhead. You can set
  `FRONT_COMMERCE_EXPRESS_LOG_ACCESS_ENABLED=false` to disable Front-Commerce
  access logs (in logs/access.log).
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_EXPERIMENTAL_NEW_RELIC_INSTRUMENT_GRAPHQL_SERVER`: set it to
  `true` to turn on an experimental logging of GraphQL resolvers metrics in New
  Relic. It uses the
  [New Relic Apollo Server plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@newrelic/apollo-server-plugin)
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_GRAPHQL_PERSISTED_QUERIES_DISABLE`: in some contexts
  [GraphQL persisted queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/)
  can be a blocker for a task. For instance, when recording a stress test
  scenario you might want fully reproducible HTTP traffic: persisted queries may
  lead to unreproducible recordings. In this case, you can set
  `FRONT_COMMERCE_GRAPHQL_PERSISTED_QUERIES_DISABLE=true` to disable the GraphQL
  server persisted queries feature (upon restart). Don't forget to turn it on
  again afterwards: **it is recommended for production use cases!**

### Sitemap

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_SITEMAP_TOKEN`: a token that secures the sitemap query in your
  GraphQL Schema

### PWA

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MODE`: in case you don't want to load the
  offline page when the user is offline

### DX

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_DEV_SSR_FALLBACK_DISABLE`: disables
  [the SSR warning page](/docs/advanced/theme/server-side-rendering#SSR-Fallback-when-things-go-wrong)
  before loading. This allows you to see what happens in production.
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_DEV_IMAGE_ERROR_DISABLE`: disables the image resizing errors
  in case you've passed malformed requests to the server. This allows you to see
  what happens in production.

## Remote services configuration

Your Front-Commerce application is an empty shell if it's not connected to
remote services. These following sections document which variables are needed
for each one of these.

### Magento 2

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_MODULE_VERSION`: the version of the Front-Commerce
  module installed on your Magento
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ENDPOINT`: the URL of the magento (ex:
  http://magento2.local)

  :::caution

  due to the way
  [token based authentication is implemented in Magento2 Web API](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/75cf82651deefef6c38b052ce40e771475607d7c/app/code/Magento/Webapi/Model/Authorization/TokenUserContext.php#L158),
  using a URL containing basic authentication credentials (such as
  http://user:password@magento2.local) is not possible yet. It would prevent
  users to login.

  :::

- Integration tokens configured in Magentoâ€™s Â« System > Extensions >
  IntegrationsÂ Â» admin page:
  - `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_CONSUMER_KEY`
  - `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_CONSUMER_SECRET`
  - `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ADMIN_TOKEN`: Admin role token to
  [detect admin users](/docs/magento2/detect-admin-users) in Front-Commerce
  configured in Â« Stores > Configurations > General > General > Front-Commerce >
  Magento Admin TokenÂ Â»
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_CACHE_API_TOKEN`: The key configured here must be identical to
  Magentoâ€™s `fc_cache_api_token` custom variable to enable cache invalidation
  from Magento2 (configured in Â« System > Other Settings > Custom Variables Â» )

### Elasticsearch

When your products are indexed in an Elasticsearch, you should put these
variables:

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_ES_HOST`: the host of your Elasticsearch instance, without
  trailing slash (ex: `http://es.front-commerce.local:9200`)
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_ES_ALIAS`: the alias prefix shared for your stores
  Elasticsearch indexes (ex: `magento2`). The store code will be appended.
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_ES_DISABLE`: setting it to `"true"` allows to disable the use
  of Elasticsearch. As of 2.5.0, if you don't want to use Elasticsearch at all,
  you can simply not enable the `datasource-elasticsearch` module. This
  environment can still be used to quickly disable Elasticsearch usage without
  changing the code.
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_ES_ELASTICSUITE_VERSION`: the version of the ElasticSuite
  module installed (only relevant for Magento2 based setup). By default,
  Front-Commerce considers a version < 2.9.
- ~~FRONT_COMMERCE_ES_VERSION: Elasticsearch server version (ex: 6.7)~~
  deprecated in `2.0.0-rc.0` and removed in `2.0.0`

### Algolia

:::info

As of Front-Commerce 2.6,
[the Algolia Front-Commerce module](/docs/magento1/search-engine#Algolia) is
automatically configured based on Magento1 configuration. Those environment
variables only apply to Front-Commerce 2.5 with Magento1.

:::

- `FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID`:
  [the Application ID](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/how-to/importing-with-the-api/#application-id)
  that identify your application in Algolia
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY`:
  [the search only API key](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/#search-only-api-key)
- `FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME_PREFIX`: a prefix to use to build index
  names

## Debugging

> _Since version 1.0.0-beta.0_

Front-Commerce leverages the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug)
package to show useful debugging information in the console. The `DEBUG`
environment variable can be used to enable logging for different part of
Front-Commerce, and some of the used libraries.

Front-Commerce debugs are in the `front-commerce` namespace. One can enable all
of them using the following definition: `DEBUG="front-commerce:*"`

The core also allows you to debug API calls to remote services made in the
server. To do so, define `DEBUG=axios`.

Both examples above can be combined as follow: `DEBUG="front-commerce:*,axios"`.
Learn more in
[the `debug` package documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug).

Here is a list of available debug namespaces:

- `axios`: debugs axios requests and responses (using
  [`axios-debug-log](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-debug-log))
- `express-http-proxy`: debugs media requests proxied by the media middleware
  (see
  [express-http-proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-http-proxy#trace-debugging))
- `express-session`: debugs cookies and how sessions are stored for each request
  (see [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session))
- `front-commerce:admin-bar`: debugs calls and role injection mechanisms for
  logging as a customer and other actions
- `front-commerce:algolia`: debugs detailed information about Algolia queries
  and interactions
- `front-commerce:authorization`: debugs proxy authorization for remote sources
  (see `makeProtectedProxyRouter.js`)
- `front-commerce:cache`: debugs cache invalidation calls and strategies
  information
- `front-commerce:cart`: debugs cart corrupted data received from remote sources
- `front-commerce:cluster`: debugs the node process id and other information to
  help configuring cluster mode
- `front-commerce:config`: dumps the configuration for a typical request at the
  `/__front-commerce/debug` URL
- `front-commerce:dispatcher`: debugs information about routes dispatching for
  registered page types
- `front-commerce:elasticsearch`: debugs all elasticsearch queries (**VERY
  VERBOSE!**)
- `front-commerce:graphql`: debugs GraphQL related code
- `front-commerce:httpauth`: debugs how
  [basic authorization](/docs/reference/configurations#config-httpAuth-js) is
  enabled
- `front-commerce:image`: debugs image proxy actions (useful to troubleshoot
  interactions with remote media servers)
- `front-commerce:payment`: debugs payment interactions to help troubleshooting
  a payment workflow
- `front-commerce:payment:adyen`: debugs advanced Adyen information (several
  information are also logged in `server.log` no matter this flag)
- `front-commerce:payment:buybox`: debugs HTTP interactions with BuyBox API
  (several information are also logged in `server.log` no matter this flag)
- `front-commerce:performance`: allow to debug server performance in production
  by enabling [server timings](/docs/advanced/performance/server-timings)
- `front-commerce:prismic`: turns [the Prismic module](/docs/category/prismic)
  debug on
- `front-commerce:prismic:cache`: debugs the Prismic caching layer specifically.
  Can be targetted directly, or included with the previous namespace using
  `DEBUG=front-commerce:prismic*`
- `front-commerce:scripts`: debugs all scripts and tooling related commands
  (webpackâ€¦)
- `front-commerce:scripts:routes`: debugs routing generation during the
  `prepare` command
- `front-commerce:shipping:mondialrelay`: debugs MondialRelay related operations
- `front-commerce:smart-forms:capency`: debugs full requests, responses and
  errors related to Capency's webservice
- `front-commerce:store-credits`: debugs responses and errors related to store
  credit (Magento 1 EE / Magento 2 Commerce)
- `front-commerce:remote-schemas`: debugs
  [remote schema stitching](/docs/advanced/graphql/remote-schemas) related
  internals
- `front-commerce:webpack`: enables `webpack-bundle-analyzer` on webpack
  client's bundle
- `front-commerce:in-stock-alert`: debugs responses and errors related to
  in-stock alerts

**Note:** one can run the `rg -iF '"front-commerce:'` to find these values.

:::note

In `development` environment, the source maps for both the server and the client
side are generated. That means you can follow our
[Debugging Guide](/docs/reference/debugging) to get started with
[JavaScript Debugging](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_debugging.asp).

:::

## Deprecation warnings

Front-Commerce leverages the [depd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depd) package
to show deprecation warnings so you can upgrade your codebase for compatibility
with the next major version.

A meaningful module name is used to scope `depd` messages, and appears at the
beginning of every output line.

One can leverage
[`depd`'s `TRACE_DEPRECATION` environment variable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depd#processenvtrace_deprecation)
to display a stack trace for each deprecation. It will help you to find the line
of code in your codebase that calls deprecated code.

Example:

```shell
TRACE_DEPRECATION=*
```

## Add your own environment variables

Depending on the amount of customization you add to your Front-Commerce
application, you may need to add new environment variables. This is possible and
don't need any particular steps. However, please keep in mind that the ones that
are safely available in your bundles are:

- in your client bundle: all the variables starting with `FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_`
- in your server bundle: all the variables starting with `FRONT_COMMERCE_`,
  including `FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_`
