There are different ways for you to accept payments with
[Ingenico](https://www.ingenico.com/) (Ogone) in your Front-Commerce
application.

- [Front-Commerce Payment](#front-commerce-payment)
  - [Configure your environment](#configure-your-environment)
  - [Register the Ogone payment module](#register-the-ogone-payment-module)
  - [Register your Ogone payment component](#register-your-ogone-payment-component)
  - [Update your CSPs](#update-your-csps)
- [Magento2 module](#magento2-module)

:::note

each integration method is independent from the others, meaning that you don't
have to install additional modules on your eCommerce platform if using
Front-Commerce payments.

:::

## Front-Commerce Payment

This section explains how to configure and customize the Ingenico Front-Commerce
Payment module into an existing Front-Commerce application. The implementation
use
[Ingenico's FlexCheckout solution](https://epayments-support.ingenico.com/en/integration/all-sales-channels/flexcheckout/index)
to create payments.

### Configure your environment

:::caution WIP

See
[Ogone related environment variables](/docs/2.x/reference/environment-variables#ogone)
for information.

:::

### Register the Ogone payment module

In your Front-Commerce application:

```diff title='.front-commerce.js'
   modules: [],
   serverModules: [
     { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
-    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" }
+    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
+    { name: "Ogone", path: "server/modules/payment-ogone" }
   ]
```

### Register your Ogone payment component

1. Override the file that lets you register additional payments forms in
   Front-Commerce

   ```shell
   mkdir -p my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/
   cp -u node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js
   ```

2. Register Ogone

   ```diff
   +import OgoneFlexCheckoutForm from "./OgoneFlexCheckoutForm";

   const ComponentMap = {
   +  ogone_flexcheckout: OgoneFlexCheckoutForm
   };
   ```

### Update your CSPs

To allow loading Ogone related remote resources:

```diff title='my-module/config/website.js'
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      scriptSrc: [],
-      frameSrc: [],
+      frameSrc: ["secure.ogone.com", "ogone.test.v-psp.com"],
      styleSrc: [],
      imgSrc: [],
      connectSrc: [],
      baseUri: []
    }
  },
```

## Magento2 module

:::caution WIP

<span>
  This integration is aimed at being transparent for administrators and
  developers. That is why we haven't duplicated documentation from existing
  Magento resources. Please <ContactLink /> if you need further assistance.
</span>

:::

Front-Commerce Magento2 module contains
[headless payment adapters](/docs/2.x/magento2/headless-payments) for the
[Ingenico ePayments **OpsCCRedirect** method](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/documentation/ecommerce-extensions/)
(Ingenicos's official Magento module).

The Ingenico module must be configured in a normal way, as for a non-headless
Magento store.
