## Manual Migration

### Shipping methods

In this release, we reworked the way additional data component can be retrieved
during the shipping method selection at checkout time.

In v2, these component were registered by overriding the
`theme/modules/Checkout/ShippingMethod/AdditionalShippingInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js`
file.

In v3, we're now leveraging on the
[feature registration hook](/docs/3.x/api-reference/front-commerce-core/extension-features#registerfeature)
so that any extension can register its own component without having to override
theme files, which greatly enhance maintainability.

Although this change is backward compatible, we recommend that you update your
`getAdditionalDataComponent` file to take advantage of the latest way of using
additional data components.

For more informations, please refer to the
[related change](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/2de78fd7361cf92295582ac5a39beaee39b5a860?merge_request_iid=3855).

### Product Cross-Sells in `ProductAddedPopin`

In this release, we've added product cross-sell recommendations to the
`ProductAddedPopin` component that appears after adding items to cart. This
enhancement allows you to display related products and increase cross-selling
opportunities.

The cross-sells are displayed in a slider format below the added product details
in the popin modal.

If you have overridden any of the following components in your project, you will
need to update them with the latest version to benefit from this new feature:
