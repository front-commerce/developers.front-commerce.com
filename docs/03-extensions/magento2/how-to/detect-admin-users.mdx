description:
  "In some specific use cases you may want to adapt the application when the
  merchant is navigating your Front-Commerce application. For instance, some
  pages may be protected and only accessible to the e-merchants of your shop.
  The rest of the users won't be able to read its content. This guide explains
  how Front-Commerce supports these use cases."
