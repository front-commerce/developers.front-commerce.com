title: Customize response HTTP headers
description:
  Front-Commerce leverages helmet to send security-related HTTP headers. This
  guide explains how to customize those HTTP headers.

As mentioned in [helmet's README file](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet):
"_It's not a silver bullet, but it can help_" preventing security issues. Here
is how to change HTTP headers sent by your application.

## `Content-Security-Policy` (_aka_ CSP)

According to
[Content Security Policy (CSP) MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP):

> Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to
> detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting
> (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from
> data theft to site defacement to distribute malware.

In a nutshell, the `Content-Security-Policy` header instructs the browser on how
it should handle resources such as JavaScript, CSS, images, â€¦ or anything it can
load on a page.

In Front-Commerce, the content of this header can be controlled by tweaking
[`contentSecurityPolicy` configuration into `config/website.js`](/docs/reference/content-security-policy.mdx).
This is where you will be able to let the browser know that for instance it can
safely load a JavaScript file from a given origin.

## Other headers

To customize other headers send by default, you have to write a custom express
middleware.

For instance, here is how you can to set
[the `Referer-Policy` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)
to `origin-when-cross-origin`:

1. [create module and add a `server/module.config.js` to declare a global server middleware](/docs/advanced/server/add-http-endpoint#add-a-global-server-middleware).
   This file would look like:

   ```js title="server/module.config.js"
   import setReferrerPolicy from "./express/setReferrerPolicy";

   export default {
     endpoint: {
       __dangerouslyOverrideBasePathChecks: true,
       path: "/",
       router: setReferrerPolicy,
     },
   };
   ```

1. write the middleware that will set the header. In this middleware, you can
   use any of the function
   [exposed by helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/#reference).

   ```js title="server/express/setReferrerPolicy.js"
   // imported in the previous snippet
   import { Router } from "express";
   import { referrerPolicy } from "helmet";

   const setReferrerPolicy = () => {
     const router = new Router();

     router.use(referrerPolicy({ policy: "origin-when-cross-origin" }));

     return router;
   };

   export default setReferrerPolicy;
   ```

And that's it. When the module having the `server/module.config.js` and
`server/express/setReferrerPolicy.js` files will be enabled in
`.front-commerce.js`, Front-Commerce will set the `Referrer-Policy` header to
`origin-when-cross-origin`.
