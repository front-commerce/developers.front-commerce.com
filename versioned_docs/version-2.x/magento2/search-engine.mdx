<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

You can configure search and product lists with filters using the following
platforms:

- [Native Magento feature](#native-search) (using its GraphQL API)
- [ElasticSearch - direct access](#elasticsearch) (using ElasticSuite)
- [Algolia](#algolia)
- [Attraqt](#attraqt)
- [Attraqt Recommendations](#attraqt-recommendations)

## Native search

<SinceVersion tag="2.15" />

Front-Commerce supports the native Magento API for search and category listing
pages. It means that any Magento search module compatible with its GraphQL API
will be used in your Front-Commerce project without any specific work.

:::danger KNOWN ISSUE

If you're using [ElasticSuite](https://elasticsuite.io/) as search engine in
Magento, you **MUST** ensure that you have a version greater than
[2.10.6](https://github.com/Smile-SA/elasticsuite/releases/tag/2.10.6).

See
["I have an error **Cannot read property 'label' of null** with Magento 2 native categories listing"](/docs/2.x/appendices/troubleshooting#i-have-an-error-cannot-read-property-label-of-null-with-magento-2-native-categories-listing)

## Elasticsearch

### Requirements

On Magento2 side, Front-Commerce requires
[Elasticsuite](https://github.com/Smile-SA/elasticsuite) and
[its CMS Page search plugin](https://github.com/Smile-SA/magento2-module-elasticsuite-cms-search)
to be installed.

The Elasticsuite installation and configuration procedure can be found
[in a dedicated page on the project wiki](https://github.com/Smile-SA/elasticsuite/wiki/ModuleInstall)
while for the CMS Page search plugin,
[the setup is detailed in its readme document](https://github.com/Smile-SA/magento2-module-elasticsuite-cms-search#how-to-use).

### Front-Commerce configuration

First, you need to make sure the Elasticsearch search client is installed with a
version that matches your Elasticsearch server version (6 or 7):

```shell
npm i @elastic/elasticsearch@7
```

On Front-Commerce side, you need to enable the Elasticsearch datasource by
making changes in your `.front-commerce.js` file similar to:

```js title=".front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  // highlight-next-line
  modules: ["./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/datasource-elasticsearch"],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    // highlight-start
    {
      name: "Magento2Elasticsearch",
      path: "datasource-elasticsearch/server/modules/magento2-elasticsearch",
    },
    // highlight-end
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
  ],
};
```

:::caution Known issue

the Elasticsearch server module needs to be enabled **before** the Magento's
module.

:::

Then, in your `.env` file, you need to define
[the variables](/docs/2.x/reference/environment-variables#elasticsearch).

```shell title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_ES_HOST=<es_host>
FRONT_COMMERCE_ES_ALIAS=<es_alias>
FRONT_COMMERCE_ES_ELASTICSUITE_VERSION=<es_elasticsuite_version>
```

:::info

The prefix value can be found in the admin interface under _Stores >
Elasticsuite > Base Settings > Indices Settings_ in the field _Indices Alias
Name_ (the default value is `magento2`).

:::

After restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able run a GraphQL query to
search for products, categories and/or pages, for instance:

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000/playground"
query Search {
  search(query: "whatever you want to search for") {
    query
    products {
      total
      products {
        sku
        name
      }
    }
    categories {
      name
    }
    pages {
      identifier
      title
    }
  }
}
```

If you are using the default theme or the Chocolatine theme, the search bar
should now be visible.

### Alternative facet filtering

Front-Commerce ElasticSearch module provides an alternative way of filtering
with facets. By default, each active facet will "refine" (i.e. substract)
results from the search and from the selectable facets. With this alternative
way, active facets for one attribute will become additive instead.

In order to activate this feature, set `search.refinementFacetsOnly` to `false`
in your `website.js`:

```diff title="src/config/website.js"
   themeColor: "#666699",
   search: {
     dynamicFacetSize: 10,
     ignoredAttributeKeys: [],
     attributeFacetMinimumDocumentCount: 1,
     authorizedCategoriesFacet: [],
     categoryFacetMinimumDocumentCount: 1,
-    refinementFacetsOnly: true,
+    refinementFacetsOnly: false,
   },
   phoneNumber: "01 02 03 04 05",
   email: "contact@example.com",
```

<a name="algolia"></a>

## Algolia connected to Magento

<SinceVersion tag="2.13" />

### Requirements

On Magento's side, you need to
[install and configure the Algolia module for Magento2](https://www.algolia.com/doc/integration/magento-2/getting-started/quick-start/?client=php#installation).

In addition, the attribute `category_ids` must be configured as both an indexed
attribute and as a facet:

1. under _Stores > Configuration > Algolia Search > Products_, add
   `category_ids` as _Searchable_ in the _Attributes_ parameter
1. under _Stores > Configuration > Algolia Search > Instant Search Result Page_,
   add `category_ids` in the _Facets_ parameter

You can then run the indexer so that the products are indexed in Algolia's
index.

:::note

`category_ids` is the only required facets. Depending on your project, you can
configure any other attribute to be exposed as a facet by following the same
steps.

:::

### Front-Commerce configuration

First, you need to make sure the Algolia's search client is installed:

```shell
npm i algoliasearch@4.8
```

On Front-Commerce side, you need to enable the Algolia datasource by making the
changes in your `.front-commerce.js` file similar to:

```js title=".front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  // highlight-next-line
  modules: ["./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/datasource-algolia"],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    // highlight-start
    {
      name: "Magento2Algolia",
      path: "datasource-algolia/server/modules/magento2-algolia",
    },
    // highlight-end
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
  ],
};
```

:::caution Known issue

the Algolia server module needs to be enabled **before** the Magento's module.

:::

Front-Commerce retrieves the following parameters from Magento:

- [the Application ID](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/how-to/importing-with-the-api/#application-id)
- [the search only API key](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/#search-only-api-key)
- the index name prefix
- the number of values per facet
- the configured facet attributes

On the configured facets, only the attribute name and the facet type are taken
into account (_Label_, _Searchable_ and _Create Query rule_ are ignored for
now).

:::note

Before version 2.21, the facet type was ignored and Front-Commerce behaved as if
the facet type was set to `Conjunctive`.

:::

:::warning

For performance reason, the configuration retrieved from Magento is cached. As a
result, after changing a parameter in the backoffice, the new parameter will be
taken into account after at most one minute by Front-Commerce.

:::

After restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able to run a GraphQL query to
search for products, categories or pages, for instance:

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000/playground"
query Search {
  search(query: "whatever you want to search for") {
    query
    products(params: { from: 0, size: 5 }) {
      total
      products {
        sku
        name
      }
    }
    categories(size: 5) {
      name
    }
    pages(size: 5) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

If you are using the default theme or the Chocolatine theme, the search bar
should now be visible.

## Algolia not connected to Magento

<SinceVersion tag="2.23" />

As of the version 2.23, it's possible to configure Front-Commerce to use Algolia
without having to install the Algolia module for Magento2.

### Requirements

In that kind of setup, you need to implement your own indexing mechanism to
replace the one provided by the Alglia module for Magento2. To help you in that
task, we provide a script to check that the indices are compatible with
Front-Commerce. This script can be run with the following command:

```bash
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=APPID \
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_API_KEY=ADMIN_API_KEY \
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME_PREFIX=INDEX_NAME_PREFIX \
npx front-commerce-algolia-check
```

The application ID and the admin API can be found in your Algolia account. The
index name prefix is a prefix of the indices that Front-Commerce will use. The
value on the command line should be the same as the one used
[to configure the Algolia module](#algolia-standalone-env).

By default, Front-Commerce is able to search for products, categories and CMS
pages, the corresponding indices need to follow some requirements.

For product indices:

- the indices name must be named after the following pattern:
  `{index_name_prefix}{store_code}_products`. For instance, in a setup where the
  index name is `myproject_` and Front-Commerce is configured to expose 2 stores
  which codes are `mystore` and `mystore2`, two indices named
  `myproject_mystore_products` and `myproject_mystore2_products` must be
  created;
- to be able to sort results by a field, some extra indices must be created by
  following the same naming convention and by adding a suffix using the pattern
  `_{sort_field}_asc` or `_{sort_field}_desc`. For instance, to allow sorting by
  created date (field `created_at`) ascending and descending, the indices
  `myproject_mystore_products_created_at_asc` and
  `myproject_mystore_products_created_at_desc` must exist;
- all documents must have a field `sku` and it must be retrievable `sku`. The
  field must contain the product `sku` as a string and for configurable product
  it should be an array of the SKUs of each configuration with the first one
  being the `sku` of the configurable product;
- all documents must have a field `category_ids`, this field must be searchable
  and configured as an attribute for facets. It must contain the category ids in
  which the product is positioned;
- all documents must have a field `price` where the price is represented as an
  object like

```json
{ "EUR": { "default": 42 }, "USD": { "default": 40 } }
```

:::note

`category_ids` is the only required facets. Depending on your project, you can
configure others facets in the index. For those facets to be taken into,
[you also have to configure the Algolia module](#algolia-standalone-config).

:::

For categories indices:

- the indices name must be named after the following pattern:
  `{index_name_prefix}{store_code}_categories`. For instance, in a setup where
  the index name is `myproject_` and Front-Commerce is configured to expose 2
  stores which codes are `mystore` and `mystore2`, two indices named
  `myproject_mystore_categories` and `myproject_mystore2_categories` must be
  created;
- the `objectID` field of each document must be the category id as a string.

For CMS page indices:

- the indices name must be named after the following pattern:
  `{index_name_prefix}{store_code}_pages`. For instance, in a setup where the
  index name is `myproject_` and Front-Commerce is configured to expose 2 stores
  which codes are `mystore` and `mystore2`, two indices named
  `myproject_mystore_pages` and `myproject_mystore2_pages` must be created.
- all documents must have a `slug` field identifying the corresponding CMS page.
  This field must be set as retrievable.

### Front-Commerce configuration

First, you need to make sure the Algolia's search client is installed:

```shell
npm i algoliasearch@4.8
```

On Front-Commerce side, you need to enable the Algolia datasource by making the
changes in your `.front-commerce.js` file similar to:

```js title=".front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  // highlight-next-line
  modules: ["./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/datasource-algolia"],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    // highlight-start
    {
      name: "StandaloneAlgolia",
      path: "datasource-algolia/server/modules/algolia",
    },
    // highlight-end
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
  ],
};
```

:::caution Known issue

the Algolia server module needs to be enabled **before** the Magento's module.

:::

<a name="algolia-standalone-env"></a>
In the .env, you need to define the following environment variables:

```bash title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=APP_ID
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY=SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME_PREFIX=myproject_
```

<a name="algolia-standalone-config"></a>

To further configure the Algolia module for instance to define facets, you have
[to create a configuration provider to override](/docs/2.x/advanced/server/configurations#override-an-existing-configuration)
[the `algoliaConfigProvider`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/65b87de451c8f0c58749369a1e8113c993028d08/modules/datasource-algolia/server/config/algoliaConfigProvider.js).

After restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able to run a GraphQL query to
search for products, categories or pages, for instance:

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000/playground"
query Search {
  search(query: "whatever you want to search for") {
    query
    products(params: { from: 0, size: 5 }) {
      total
      products {
        sku
        name
      }
    }
    categories(size: 5) {
      name
    }
    pages(size: 5) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

If you are using the default theme or the Chocolatine theme, the search bar
should now be visible.

## Attraqt

<SinceVersion tag="2.19" />

### Requirements

Due to the way Attraqt works, you will have to ensure your Attraqt index is
Front-Commerce-ready before hand. In order to check this, we have added a simple
script that check the basics for you, and tells what's missing from your current
index.

Using your Attraqt's search API key, you can execute this command from your
Front-Commerce repository:

```shell
FRONT_COMMERCE_ATTRAQT_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_api_key npx front-commerce-attraqt-check
```

:::info

You can find your search API key by logging in in into
[the XO console](https://console.early-birds.io/), and navigating to:
`Search > API Keys`

:::

The script should be very quick to execute, and will let you now what needs your
attention in your Attraqt index. If you have any doubt on how to change this, do
not hesitate to ask your Attraqt CSM.

When you get the ✔️ as a response from the script, you are ready to use Attraqt
with Front-Commerce.

### Facets

Due to facet IDs not being editable in Attraqt, facets created in your Attraqt
console must be based on your Magento attributes exact names.

By example, if you have an attribute `fashion_colour` in your product and you
want to add a facet for it, the facet in attraqt _must_ be based on an attribute
named `fashion_colour` as well, which will create a facet with ID
`facet-fashion_colour`.

### Front-Commerce configuration

First, you need to make sure the Attraqt's search client is installed:

```shell
npm i @attraqt/xo-js@1.6.0
```

On Front-Commerce side, you need to enable the Attraqt datasource by making the
following changes in your .front-commerce.js file:

```js title=".front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  // highlight-next-line
  modules: ["./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/datasource-attraqt"],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    // highlight-start
    {
      name: "Magento2Attraqt",
      path: "datasource-attraqt/server/modules/magento2-attraqt",
    },
    // highlight-end
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
  ],
};
```

:::caution Known issue

The Attraqt server module needs to be enabled **before** the Magento module.

:::

Then, in your `.env` file, you need to define the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_ATTRAQT_SEARCH_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash title=.env
FRONT_COMMERCE_ATTRAQT_SEARCH_API_KEY=yourapikeyvalue
```

After restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able run a GraphQL query to
search for products, categories and/or pages, for instance:

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000/playground"
query Search {
  search(query: "whatever you want to search for") {
    query
    products(params: { from: 0, size: 5 }) {
      total
      products {
        sku
        name
      }
    }
    categories(size: 5) {
      name
    }
    pages(size: 5) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

If you are using the default theme or the Chocolatine theme, the search bar
should now be visible.

:::tip

In case of emergency, Front-Commerce provides
[a configuration to quickly deactivate Attraqt's search feature](/docs/2.x/reference/environment-variables#attraqt).
Use the `FRONT_COMMERCE_ATTRAQT_DISABLED=true` and restart your application to
temporarily deactivate the module.

:::

### Add contextual information to your queries

<SinceVersion tag="2.23" />

Front-Commerce allows you to leverage
[Attraqt's Context](https://attraqt.gitbook.io/developer-documentation/xo-search/api-parameters/context)
feature in your application. This is a great way to add contextual information
to your queries, so that you can get results adapted to your users needs.

Contexts can be provided at different levels, from the most generic to the most
specific. Context values will be used as **Attraqt context variables**. Here's
how to do it in your application.

#### Global context

The simplest way to add context variables to all your queries is to use a global
context. Front-Commerce's Attraqt module has a configuration for it:
`config.attraqt.globalContext`. It is defined in the `Attraqt`
[configuration provider](/docs/2.x/advanced/server/configurations), so you can
use any extension mechanism at your disposal to customize this value.

Example: an app-wide context for every users and queries

```js
import configService from "server/core/config/configService";

const myAppConfigProvider = {
  name: "myAppConfig",
  values: Promise.resolve({
    attraqt: {
      globalContext: {
        source: "storefront",
        version: "1.0.0",
      },
    },
  }),
};

configService.insertAfter("Attraqt", myAppConfigProvider);
```

Example: a global context dynamically determined per request

```js
import mem from "mem";
import configService from "server/core/config/configService";

const getContextFromShopId = mem((shopId) => {
  return {
    attraqt: {
      globalContext: {
        source: `storefront_${shopId}`,
        // […] more compute intensive variables here
      }
    },
  };
});

const myAppConfigProvider = {
  name: "myAppConfig",
  slowValuesOnEachRequest: (_req, config) => {
    return getContextFromShopId(config.currentShopId);
  };
};

configService.insertAfter("Attraqt", myAppConfigProvider);
```

You can also use remote values or per user values using
[other configuration providers features](/docs/2.x/advanced/server/configurations).

#### Layer-specific context

Contexts can also be provided at the _layer level_. It allows to add context
variables only for search queries restricted to a single item kind (e.g:
categories).

To do so, you must use the `context` option of `datasource.buildLayer()`
function in your application. Example:

```js
const layer = searchDatasource.buildLayer({
  type: "categories",
  // your context variables here
  context: {
    priority: "online_sales",
    foo: "bar",
  },
  executeQuery: executeCategoryQuery,
  formatHit: searchDatasource.formatters.category,
  fetchErrorFallback: () => () => {
    return Promise.reject();
  },
});
```

:::info

Layer-specific context replace the global context.

:::

#### Query-specific context

Finally, you can also implement advanced use cases by adding contextual
information directly in the `SearchQuery`. It means that any scope, pagination
or facet can update a query context.

To do so, you must use the `addContext` method of `SearchQuery`. Example: a
context based implementation of random sorting could be implemented like this

```js
const randomizable =
  () =>
  ({ random = false }) => {
    return (searchQuery) => {
      if (random) {
        searchQuery.addContext({ randomSort: true });
      }
      return searchQuery;
    };
  };

export default randomizable;
```

:::info

Query-specific context is merged with global/layer-specific context variables.
It can override specific variables while keeping others unchanged.

:::

### Attraqt recommendations

<SinceVersion tag="2.19" />

Front-Commerce provides a loader to retrieve recommendations from
[Attraqt's Widgets](https://attraqt.gitbook.io/developer-documentation/xo-recommendations/readme-first).

#### Front-Commerce configuration

To enable the Attraqt recommendation module, you need to add it to your
`.front-commerce.js` config:

```js title=".front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  // highlight-next-line
  modules: ["./node_modules/front-commerce/modules/recommendations-attraqt"],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "server/modules/front-commerce" },
    // highlight-start
    {
      name: "AttraqtRecommendations",
      path: "recommendations-attraqt/server/modules/attraqt-recommendations",
    },
    // highlight-end
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
  ],
  webModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "./src/web" },
    // highlight-start
    {
      name: "AttraqtRecommendation",
      path: "front-commerce/modules/recommendations-attraqt/web",
    },
    // highlight-end
  ],
};
```

Then, you need to define the API url in your environment variables:

```bash title=.env
FRONT_COMMERCE_ATTRAQT_RECOMMENDATION_API_URL=http://api.early-birds.io/widget
```

#### Using Attraqt Orchestrator Chrome extension

In order to use the
[Attraqt Orchestrator extension for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/attraqt-experience-orches/icognleckonecpphokboemgcgcohcepi),
Front-Commerce exposes a GraphQL interface and provides a front-end component
which does the needed setup. In this example, we'll make a module
`SuggestedProduct` that fetches a recommendation from Attraqt via
Front-Commerce's loader, and use it to initialize Attraqt Orchestrator

:::note

See [Extend the GraphQL schema](/docs/2.x/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema)
for instructions on how to add your own GraphQL module.

:::

You will first need to update your GraphQL schema to implement this interface
and use it in a query:

```graphql title="my-module/server/modules/SuggestedProducts/schema.gql"
type ProductRecommendation implements AttraqtRecommendationResult {
  id: ID!
  products: [Product]
}

extend type Query {
  productRecommendation: ProductRecommendation
}
```

Add a resolver for this query:

```js title="my-module/server/modules/SuggestedProducts/resolvers.js"
export default {
  Query: {
    productRecommendation: async (_, __, { loaders }) => {
      return loaders.AttraqtRecommendations.loadRecommendationsForWidget(
        "my-widget-id"
      );
    },
  },
  ProductRecommendation: {
    products: async (recommendation, _, { loaders }) => {
      // Note: the shape of recommendation.recommendations will vary
      // depending on your data indexed in Attraqt. Adapt this example to your use case.
      const skus = recommendation.recommendations
        .map(({ id }) => id)
        .filter(Boolean);
      return loaders.Product.loadBySkus(skus);
    },
  },
};
```

On the front-end side, retrieve the results from this query using the GraphQL
fragment provided by Front-Commerce:

```graphql title="my-module/web/theme/modules/SuggestedProducts/SuggestedProductsQuery.gql"
#import "theme/modules/AttraqtRecommendations/AttraqtRecommendationResultFragment.gql"
#import "theme/pages/Product/ProductFragment.gql"

query SuggestedProductsQuery {
  productRecommendation {
    ...AttraqtRecommendationResultFragment
    products {
      ...ProductFragment
    }
  }
}
```

You can now use it in a component:

```js title="my-module/web/theme/modules/SuggestedProducts/SuggestedProducts.js"
import React from "react";
import AttraqtRecommendationChromeExtensionRegisterer from "theme/modules/AttraqtRecommendations/attraqtRecommendationChromeExtensionRegisterer.js";
import { graphql } from "react-apollo";
import SuggestedProductsQuery from "./SuggestedProductsQuery.gql";

const SuggestedProducts = ({ recommendation }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <AttraqtRecommendationChromeExtensionRegisterer
        recommendation={recommendation}
      />
      {/* ... Display products */}
    </>
  );
};

export default graphql(SuggestedProductsQuery, {
  props: ({ data }) => {
    return {
      recommendation: data.loading ? null : data.productRecommendation,
    };
  },
})(SuggestedProducts);
```

With this example, Attraqt's Chrome extension should be initialized correctly
when accessing the page were `SuggestedProducts` is used.

## Fallback Search

<SinceVersion tag="2.15" />

If no search module is configured Front-Commerce will default to using the
native Magento search API to do the search.

native Magento search API uses the price without tax value to achieve its price
filtering capabilities. This is not what customers typically expect. To overcome
this you need to set `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_SEARCH_TAX_RATE` to the expected
tax rate on your site. Please note this may not work for all scenarios as you
may have different tax rates depending on country. So we recommend you use the
tax rate that most applies to your customers.
