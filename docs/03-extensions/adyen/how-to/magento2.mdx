Front-Commerce is compatible with
[Adyen's official Magento headless integration](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/magento-2/magento-headless-integration)
in its native version.

This integration is slightly different from
[traditional Magento2 headless payments](/docs/2.x/magento2/headless-payments)
in the sense that it contains a "companion component" in Front-Commerce. The
component allows to display and Authorize payments from the checkout page, using
[Adyen's Web Drop-in integration](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/drop-in-web)
on the front-end. No redirection to other payment platforms is involved unless
it is absolutely necessary, the customer remains on the Front-Commerce store.

Here is how to set this payment method up.

## Adyen Magento 2 integration installation

Follow [Adyen's documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/magento-2) to
install and configure the official Magento2 extension for Adyen payments. We
currently support any version from
[7.2.0](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-magento2/releases/tag/7.2.0) to
[8.x](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-magento2/releases/tag/8.0.0).

:::tip

If you were using Adyen with Magento2 without Front-Commerce, don't forget to
check Adyen settings. For instance, make sure
[allowed origins set the step 1](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/adobe-commerce/set-up-adyen-customer-area/?tab=manual_2)
match you setup with Front-Commerce.

:::

You must configure the extension's Headless/PWA settings with your
Front-Commerce URL **for each of your stores**. Settings
[changed in version 8.0.0](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-magento2/releases/tag/8.0.0),
so it will be slightly different depending on your version.

- `< 8`: configure "Payment Origin URL" in the `Advanced: PWA` section
- `>= 8`: configure `Advanced settings > Headless Integration` with
  - Payment Origin URL: your Front-Commerce URL (e.g:
    [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/))
  - Payment Return URL: the `/adyen/process/result` path (e.g:
    [http://localhost:4000/adyen/process/result](http://localhost:4000/adyen/process/result))
  - Custom Success Redirect Path: same value as Payment Return URL

:::info important

Please note that enabling or disabling payments in Magento's admin area has no
effect on payment methods visible on the storefront. This is a _feature_ of the
module: every active payment method in Adyen will be available. **You either
have to filter them in the frontend or from your Adyen account.**

:::

## Front-Commerce configuration

[After installing the Adyen package](/docs/3.x/extensions/adyen/#installation),
you need to enable the corresponding extension. For that, you need to tweak your
`front-commerce.config.ts` file like:

```typescript title="front-commerce.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/config";
import themeChocolatine from "@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine";
import magento2 from "@front-commerce/magento2"; // or magento1
// highlight-next-line
import adyen from "@front-commerce/adyen";
import storesConfig from "./app/config/stores";
import cacheConfig from "./app/config/caching";

export default defineConfig({
  extensions: [
    magento2(storesConfig),
    themeChocolatine(),
    // highlight-next-line
    adyen(magento2), // ⚠️ must be after themeChocolatine()
  ],
  stores: storesConfig,
  cache: cacheConfig,
  configuration: {
    providers: [],
  },
});
```

## Add the required environment variables

In the .env, you need to define the following environment variables:

```sh title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=live_32charactersstring
# the Adyen client key is prefixed with live_ or test_
FRONT_COMMERCE_ADYEN_MAGENTO_MODULE_VERSION=8.3.3
FRONT_COMMERCE_ADYEN_STORE_PAYMENT_DETAILS=true
```

See our
[extension reference](/docs/3.x/extensions/adyen/reference/environment-variables)
for more information about these variables.

## Register your Adyen payment components

:::note

This is a temporary way to setup payment components. We are aware that it is
tedious. It will definitely change in the future, when Front-Commerce will
support new extension points for Payments.

:::

1. Override the file that lets you register additional payments forms in
   Front-Commerce

   ```shell
   mkdir -p app/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/
   cp -u node_modules/@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js app/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js
   ```

2. Register Adyen

   ```diff title="app/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js"
   +import AdyenCheckout from "theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/AdyenCheckout";

   const ComponentMap = {};

   const getAdditionalDataComponent = (method) => {
   +  if (method.code.startsWith("adyen_")) {
   +    return AdyenCheckout;
   +  }
     return ComponentMap[method.code];
   };
   ```

3. Override the file that lets you register additional payments actions in
   Front-Commerce

   ```shell
   mkdir -p app/theme/modules/Checkout/PlaceOrder
   cp -u node_modules/@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine/theme/modules/Checkout/PlaceOrder/getAdditionalActionComponent.js app/theme/modules/Checkout/PlaceOrder/getAdditionalActionComponent.js
   ```

4. Register the Adyen action

   ```diff title="app/theme/modules/Checkout/PlaceOrder/getAdditionalActionComponent.js"
   import None from "theme/modules/Checkout/PlaceOrder/AdditionalAction/None";
   +import Adyen from "theme/modules/Checkout/PlaceOrder/AdditionalAction/Adyen";

   const ComponentMap = {};

   const getAdditionalActionComponent = (paymentCode, paymentAdditionalData) => {
   +  if (paymentCode.startsWith("adyen")) {
   +    return Adyen;
   +  }
     return ComponentMap?.[paymentCode] ?? None;
   };
   ```

## Register custom styles (optional)

Developers can
[customize Adyen drop-in UI styles using CSS](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout/drop-in-web/customization).

You can add an optional stylesheet from Front-Commerce in your application to
customize styles. The provided stylesheet reuses existing styles from the theme
as much as possible for a good integration by default. You can override it if
needed to adapt the UI as wanted.

Add the following line to your your main `.scss` file to load these styles:

```scss
@import "theme/modules/Adyen/dropinCustomizations";
```

## Enable Adyen's Stored Payment Methods (optional)

You can opt for Adyen to store your customers' credit card information to allow
a faster checkout experience.

In order to do so:

- Add `FRONT_COMMERCE_ADYEN_STORE_PAYMENT_DETAILS=true` in your `.env` file
- Follow
  [Adyen's guide](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/magento-2/set-up-tokenization?tab=magento-vault-version-8-2-0_2#set-up-adyen-tokenization)
  on how to setup tokenization using Adyen's Magento module.

If you are using the default Front-Commerce Adyen component, your customer
should now be able to save their credit card information during checkout by
checking the "Save for my next payment" checkbox.

### Enable Paypal payments

To enable PayPal payments, you need to:

- [add PayPal payment method](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/paypal/web-drop-in)
  in your Adyen account
- enable Adyen's `Alternative Payment Methods` in your Magento2 backend, located
  in
  `Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods > Adyen Payments > Configure payment methods`

## Enable Google Pay payments

To enable Google Pay payments, you need to
[add Google Pay payment method](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/google-pay/web-drop-in)
in your Adyen account.

## Test it

You can now configure the Magento extension to use a Test mode and
[test the integration](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/test-cards/test-card-numbers)

:::note

Please keep in mind that Adyen payment methods depends on the Customer country,
the Cart amount and the Store currency. Different contexts could display
different payment methods in the checkout.
