>
> **We highly recommend this upgrade to Magento 2 users.** The `2.2.0-rc.4`
> release fixes Magento and Front-Commerce API that were exposing products from
> other websites in a multistore environment. Many edge cases were found with
> our deep investigations: bundle items all out of stock, grouped products,
> crossell products only in another website etc.
>
> We ended up fixing many things from the core ourselves, and hope you'll now
> have a consistent catalog !
