## Welcome to Front-Commerce’s official documentation

Even though Front-Commerce is a proprietary product, we have decided to maintain
our documentation in the open.

**It means that you could understand how the product works and see code samples
before to help you decide whether Front-Commerce is relevant for your project or
not.**

It also means that you are encouraged to contribute to the documentation and
help us making it as good as possible. Keep
[Uncle Bob’s famous « Boy Scout Rule »](http://wiki.c2.com/?BoyScoutRule) in
mind… any contributions is welcome (fixing a typo, adding troubleshooting,
opening an issue to suggest new content).

Each page contains a direct « Edit on GitHub » link to allow you to quickly
suggest a change or fix typo/grammar mistakes while reading it.

## Getting Help

If you need help or more information about a topic, there are different ways
[you can get help](/help.html).

## First Steps

Grasping all the concepts around a product such as Front-Commerce is exciting,
but can be intimidating. We tried to create and organize this documentation in a
way that you could quickly find the information you need depending on your
context.

This documentation lives in a more global website for developers, so you might
be able to find more information in our [blog posts](/blog) or content pages.

Whether you want to [understand our vision](vision.md) or get an
[architectural overview of Front-Commerce](architecture-overview.md) as a system
and its internals you can start here.

In case you have made your choice and want to start your project, you might be
interested by information on [our licensing process](/license.html) and then all
the documentation to [get your project started](getting-started.md).

If your project is running and you are developing new features, we have some
[practical recipes](recipes.md) to help you getting things done (and soon an
API).

> **Coming soon**: we will also publish an API reference from our code with our
> main technical modules documented. We are waiting for the v1.0 to ensure we
> are only documenting what will stay in our final codebase.

Last but not least, if you are upgrading a project to the latest Front-Commerce
version, we have documented some [Migration guides](migration-guides.md) to make
the process as seamless as possible.

As always, if you do not find what you need do not hesitate to
[ask for help](/help.html) and tell us what is missing.
