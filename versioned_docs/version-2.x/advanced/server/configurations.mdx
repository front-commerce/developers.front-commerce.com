In this guide we will see how they work and how to create new configurations or
override existing ones.

## What is a configuration provider?

The goal is to give access to a configuration object that contains all the
configuration of the store. This configuration object can contain any kind of
configuration. It can be flags about a feature activation, some credentials to
connect to a remote service, etc.

However, not all applications will need every single configuration. For
instance, a shop that chose to use [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) won't
have the same configurations than a shop that chose
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for product search. The goal of the
configuration providers is to define the configurations needed for the specific
modules you use in your application.

On server start, the configuration providers will then be combined to create the
global configuration object. This configuration object will then be available on
each server request.

This can be illustrated by starting your Front-Commerce server with the
environment variable `DEBUG=front-commerce:config`. If your server is running on
`http://localhost:4000` and you open the URL
[`/__front-commerce/debug`](http://localhost:4000/__front-commerce/debug), you
will have a dump of the configuration for this specific request under the
section `req.config`.

:::note

The section is called `req.config` in reference to the `req` object that
contains the current user request. Whenever you need to have access to the
configuration object, please look for a `req` object will have the key `config`.
For instance, in GraphQL modules,
[the `req` object is available in the `contextEnhancer`](/docs/2.x/reference/graphql-module-definition#contextenhancer-optional).

:::

```json
{
  "allShops": {
    "store:default": {
      "id": "default",
      "url": "http://localhost:4000",
      "locale": "en-GB",
      "magentoStoreCode": "default",
      "currency": "EUR"
    }
  },
  "currentShopId": "default",
  "cache": {
    "defaultMaxBatchSize": 100,
    "strategies": [
      {
        "implementation": "Redis",
        "supports": "*",
        "disabledFor": [],
        "config": {
          "host": "localhost"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "magento": {
    "endpoint": "http://magento23.test",
    "version": "2",
    "proxiedPaths": []
  }
}
```

Don't activate this on a public instance as it can expose sensitive data

## Configuration provider definition

In practice, a configuration provider is an object with five properties: a name,
a schema, static values (available independently from the request), a function
to resolve values depending on the request and a function to fetch values
remotely.

```js
const serviceConfigurationProvider = {
  name,
  schema,
  values,
  slowValuesOnEachRequest,
  fetchRemoteConfiguration,
};
```

See the sections below to understand what each key stands for.

### Name (key `name`, mandatory)

The identifier of the configuration provider. This is needed for configuration
providers' registration. See
[Register a configuration provider](#register-a-configuration-provider) for more
details.

```js
const name = "serviceProvider";
```

### Schema (key `schema`, optional)

It's a function returning an object representing the definition of the fields
that will appear in the global configuration object if the configuration
provider is registered. It can define things like field formats, default values
or environment variables.

The schema definition is based on
[convict](https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict), a library developed by
Mozilla to validate configurations. For a single field, the schema will have
these keys:

- `doc` (string): A description of the field and pointers to learn how to get
  its value if it requires a manual operation
- `format` (string, array or function): The formatter used for this field's
  value. See
  [how validation works in convict](https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict#validation).
- `default` (any): A default value. If you don't have a default value, you still
  have to set one by using the `null`. If there is no default value, it won't be
  considered as a field definition.
- `env` (string, optional): The name of the environment variable that should be
  used as the value. If none is given, the configuration won't be configurable
  by environment. Please keep in mind that environment variables should still
  match
  [Front-Commerce's naming convention](/docs/2.x/reference/environment-variables#add-your-own-environment-variables).

Thus, if we want to define a configuration named `serviceKey` available in
`req.config.serviceKey` that would take its value from the environment variable
`FRONT_COMMERCE_SERVICE_KEY`, we would use this schema definition:

```js
const schema = () => ({
  serviceKey: {
    doc: "The key to get access to our remote service",
    format: String,
    default: null,
    env: "FRONT_COMMERCE_SERVICE_KEY",
  },
});
```

A configuration provider's schema is not limited to a single field though. You
can set multiple configuration keys but also nest deeper objects. For instance,
if we want to group a `key` and a `secret` into a single `service` key, we would
write the following schema:

```js
const schema = () => ({
  service: {
    key: {
      doc: "The key to get access to our remote service",
      format: String,
      default: null,
      env: "FRONT_COMMERCE_SERVICE_KEY",
    },
    secret: {
      doc: "The secret to get access to our remote service",
      format: String,
      default: null,
      env: "FRONT_COMMERCE_SERVICE_SECRET",
    },
  },
});
```

You could then access the values with `req.config.service.key` or
`req.config.service.secret`.

Please note that if another configuration provider's schema also defined a
`service` key, it would merge the definitions and in your final
`req.config.service` you would have both the keys from the other configuration
provider's schema and from the above schema.

### Static values (key `values`, optional)

Most of the time `default` values in the schema is sufficient. However, in some
cases you may need to fetch some values from an API, a dynamic file, etc. This
is what `values` is for.

It is an optional promise that should return the missing values in your schema.
It will override default values and env values from the schema with the new
values. However only keys from the `values` result will take precedence, the
default values and env values will be kept for other keys. For instance, if we
implemented the following `values` promise, the `secret` would still be
`process.env.FRONT_COMMERCE_SERVICE_SECRET` from the above schema.

```js
const values = fetch("https://api.example.com/my-service-key")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((key) => ({
    service: {
      key: key,
    },
  }));
```

Please note that this promise is launched only once on server bootstrap. If the
configuration changes over time on your API, the `req.config.service.key` value
will still be the same.

If it needs to change over time, please use `slowValuesOnEachRequest` or
`fetchRemoteConfiguration` instead.

### Values depending on the request (key `slowValuesOnEachRequest`, optional)

:::note

`slowValuesOnEachRequest` is a low level API in Front-Commerce. You shouldn't
need it in most cases.

:::

`slowValuesOnEachRequest` is a function that extracts configuration values from
the current request. For instance, depending on the URL, the configuration
`currentShopId` will get a different id and thus display different information.

```js
const slowValuesOnEachRequest = (req) => {
  const url = req.originalUrl;
  const shopId = getShopIdFromUrl(url);
  return {
    currentShopId: shopId,
  };
};
```

:::caution

This part is named `slowValuesOnEachRequest` because we want to stress the fact
that it can have a huge impact on your website performance. Avoid its usage as
much as you can and try to use `values` instead. If this is the only way to
setup your configuration make sure to memoize its result to limit the
performance impact as much as possible.

```js
import memoize from "lodash/memoize";

const getShopIdFromHostname = memoize((hostname) => {
  /* The definition of the `currentShopId` variable should live here */
  return {
    currentShopId: currentShopId,
  };
});

const slowValuesOnEachRequest = (req) => {
  const hostname = req.hostname;
  return getShopIdFromHostname(req.hostname);
};
```

:::

### Remotely fetched values (key `fetchRemoteConfiguration`, optional)

:::note

`fetchRemoteConfiguration` is a low level API in Front-Commerce. You shouldn't
need it in most cases.

:::

`fetchRemoteConfiguration` is a function that is called at a later stage in
Front-Commerce request handling cycle to receive a fully initialized `request`
object, so that, for instance,
[you can instantiate a loader to retrieve some configuration from Magento](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/f57ccabae32ebe6243fc213485078cb1f98f8a30#9e3c152a167c50222b152728db1b5946d409ba89_0_29).

:::caution

Like `slowValuesOnEachRequest`, `fetchRemoteConfiguration` can have a huge
impact on the performances. If you really need to implement it, please make sure
to memoize its result to limit the performance impact as much as possible.

:::

## Register a configuration provider

Once you have defined a configuration provider, you will need to tell your
application when it should be fused with the rest of the configurations. To do
so, there is a `configService`, available at `server/core/config/configService`
that lets you register new configuration providers.

```js
import configService from "server/core/config/configService";

configService.append(serviceConfigurationProvider);
```

But where should you add this code? It should live in the file where you are
using the configuration. For instance, if I need the service's key and secret in
a `contextEnhancer` of a GraphQL module, I'd add it at the top level of the file
containing my `contextEnhancer`.

```diff
import ServiceLoader from "./loaders";
+import serviceConfigurationProvider from "./serviceConfigurationProvider";
+import configService from "server/core/config/configService";
+
+configService.append(serviceConfigurationProvider);

export default {
  name: "Service",
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  contextEnhancer: ({ req }) => {
    return {
-      Service: ServiceLoader({
-        key: "key",
-        secret: "secret"
-      })
+      Service: ServiceLoader(req.config.service)
    };
  }
};
```

It is also common to register a configuration provider from
[an express middleware](/docs/2.x/advanced/server/add-http-endpoint#add-a-global-server-middleware)
for cases where the corresponding configuration is used in several places in the
application.

### Override an existing configuration

If your configuration provider relies on another one, you should use the
following method
`configService.insertAfter(otherConfigurationProviderName, serviceConfigurationProvider)`.

Please note that your configuration provider does not need to be complete to
work. It can for instance rely on an existing schema and only define `values` to
override the default values. This can be useful if you want to override
configuration already defined in Front-Commerce and fetch them with another
method. In this case, your configuration provider would look like this:

```js
import configService from "server/core/config/configService";

const serviceOverrideProvider = {
  name: "serviceOverride",
  values: Promise.resolve({
    service: {
      key: "new value",
    },
  }),
};

configService.insertAfter("serviceProvider", serviceOverrideProvider);
```

### Overriding express configuration provider

If you want to override the configuration of express, you will need to add the
new configuration in a middleware definition file `module.config.js`.

For example, if you want to increase the maximum size for `POST` payloads:

```js title="my-module/server/module.config.js"
import configService from "server/core/config/configService";

const expressServiceProvider = {
  name: "expressOverride",
  values: {
    express: {
      jsonParserConfig: {
        limit: "10mb",
      },
      graphQLBodyParserConfig: {
        limit: "10mb",
      },
    },
  },
};

configService.append(expressServiceProvider);

export default {};
```

## Core configuration providers

Our goal is to use these configuration providers for any configuration that
could exist in Front-Commerce. However, this is still a work in progress and
there are still some configurations that are not associated with a schema yet.
Most configurations are still based on files in the
[`config` folder of your project's module](/docs/2.x/reference/configurations).
