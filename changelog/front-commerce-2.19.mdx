## 2.19: the first version of our connector with the search tool Attraqt, Google Analytics 4 for Front-Commerce, GitLab Migration, and Chronopost Relay

It's been a busy autumn for Front-Commerce!

We launched our first version of the
[Front-Commerce Cockpit](https://cockpit.front-commerce.com/) and were able to
work on a variety of topics, for the core of Front-Commerce, our cloud offering,
and many other topics!

Without further ado, here is the Front-Commerce 2.19.0 program, with a whole
host of new features:

- We have developed the first version of our connector with the headless search
  tool [Attraqt](https://attraqt.com/)
- We worked on a beta version for the API-first content platform
  [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
- We made Front-Commerce compatible with Google Analytics 4
- We ensured compatibility with Magento 2.4.5 for Front-Commerce
- We made [Chronopost Relay Pick-up](https://www.chronopost.fr/fr/relais-pickup)
  available for Front-Commerce with Magento 2
- We migrated our code away from [Gitlab.com](http://gitlab.com/) to cope with
  the
  [new Gitlab.com pricing](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/03/24/efficient-free-tier/)
  not being adapted to our context

As always, should you have any requests regarding the product roadmap, do not

### Analytics: a new foundation allowing to use GA4 with Front-Commerce

As announced by Google,
[Universal Analytics will disappear on July 1, 2023](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en).
[Google Analytics 4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681) is a
next-generation measurement solution and is replacing Universal Analytics.

Well, good news: from 2.19, Front-Commerce is compatible with Google Analytics
4!

Compatibility with <abbr title="Google Analytics 4">GA4</abbr> forced us to
prioritize a new foundation for our analytics components.

The library we previously used (analytics.js) has changed over time and the
latest versions require merchants to use [Segment.com](https://segment.com/). We
considered this as a blocker and benchmarked different alternatives for
platform-agnostic analytics tracking.

We selected the `analytics` library
([https://getanalytics.io/](https://getanalytics.io/)) as a new foundation for
our core analytics components. Front-Commerce 2.19 allows you to leverage this
new foundation to use up-to-date integrations with the main platforms you might
need, **including Google Analytics 4**.

Here are some highlights of this new version:

- It has a similar intuitive plugin system, which fills all our analytical
  requirements.
- Out-of-the-Box Integrations (plug & play) already cover the main existing use
  cases we've identified so far:
  [Simple Analytics](https://getanalytics.io/plugins/simple-analytics/)
  ([https://www.simpleanalytics.com/](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/)) and
  [Plausible](https://github.com/DavidWells/analytics/issues/96#issuecomment-1029021278)
  ([https://plausible.io/](https://plausible.io/)) are GDPR-friendly solution
  you can already use as an alternative to Google Analytics if need be.
- You (and we) could contribute new plugins in the future. See the current
  [plugin requests](https://github.com/DavidWells/analytics/issues/153) (we plan
  to contribute [Matomo](https://fr.matomo.org/) - french GDPR-friendly
  alternative to Google - in the near future)
- We kickstarted a new
  [Analytics Examples](https://github.com/front-commerce/examples) repository, providing 
  integration examples for common plugins not yet included in 
  [Analytics](https://getanalytics.io/), also feel free to contribute if you have any ideas!

For previous versions of Front-Commerce (2.18 and below),
[we detailed the procedure to migrate from Analytics.js to Analytics.io on our Help site](https://help.front-commerce.com/en/articles/6682944-how-to-use-google-analytics-4-in-front-commerce).
However, we recommend upgrading your Front-Commerce version to 2.19 for an
easier integration.

### Attraqt: the first version of the connector (Search and Merchandising)

Front-Commerce is already compatible with
[Algolia](/docs/2.x/magento2/search-engine#algolia),
[ElasticSearch](/docs/2.x/magento2/search-engine#elasticsearch), and
[Magento 2‚Äôs native search](/docs/2.x/magento2/search-engine#native-search)
features. With our Attraqt connector, you now have a whole range of solutions to
offer your customers an outstanding experience while browsing your website and
searching for content, whether that is products, categories, or even blog posts.

Here is a quick demo of the connector:

  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

### Chronopost Relay for Front-Commerce with Magento2

Within our shipping methods, we already handle
[Colissimo](/docs/2.x/advanced/shipping/colissimo) and
[Mondial Relay](/docs/2.x/advanced/shipping/mondial-relay), displaying a map
directly in Front-Commerce to help your customers select the pick-up point they
want their products to be delivered to.

Magento2 retailers can now provide Chronopost pick-up point selection to their
customers. Front-Commerce 2.19 brings compatibility with Magento2 to the
[Chronopost official extension](https://www.chronopost.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/guide_magento_2.pdf).

Here is a quick demo:

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

### Performance Improvements: fewer API calls for faster applications!

As a headless front-end solution for e-retailers, we strive to improve your
application's web performance.

In Front-Commerce 2.19, we added some improvements directly related to
transactional events, by reducing the number of cart-related API calls and
adding support for current customer caching in session. These changes are
available for Magento2, and
[must be enabled in your project](/docs/2.x/appendices/migration-guides/#new-features-in-2190)
after upgrading to 2.19.

This should help you gain precious performance points and directly impact your
conversion rates!

### Contentful: beta version

During the past weeks, we built a beta version of a connector with the API-first
content platform [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). The results are very
promising. To test it in real conditions, we were able to deploy a full Adobe
Commerce B2B x Front-Commerce x Contentful demo.

### Magento 2.4.5 compatibility

Magento launched version 2.4.5 in August 2022.

At Front-Commerce, to ensure compatibility with different modules and provide a
safe migration path to our Magento customers, we‚Äôve decided to provide
compatibility with new Magento versions for their "p1" releases.

This is done with Front-Commerce 2.19, compatible with the Community Edition and
Commerce Edition of Magento 2.4.5-p1 (which was planned for the 11th of October:
see
[Magento release schedule](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/release/planning/schedule.html))

‚è≠Ô∏è¬†The next compatibility version will be made with Magento 2.4.6-p1, for which
the date is still unknown (Magento 2.4.6 is planned for March 14, 2023)

### Autumn clean: technical debt management and low-hanging fruits

For the first Autumn days, we decided to treat ourselves to a week of tackling
technical debt issues and low-hanging fruit tasks that we‚Äôd postponed or had no
time to deal with before (if you are a developer or work with developers, you
should know all about this üôÉ)

This "out of the flow" week allowed us to tackle small topics that you will find
in [the Other Changes section.](#other-changes)

### GitLab Migration: welcome Blackswift!

Earlier this year, Gitlab
[announced a new pricing](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/03/24/efficient-free-tier/)
that took place on October 19, 2022. Much like for many other users,
[this new pricing was not adapted to our context](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/gitlab-introduces-user-limits-for-free-users-on-saas/64288/138).
We discovered this information in September and have been trying to find the
best solution since then.

We've decided to migrate our repositories and users from Gitlab.com to another
Gitlab SaaS provider: [Blackswift](https://blackswift.fr/) üá´üá∑. We continue to
provide you the code and everything you already know‚Ä¶ the only difference is the
domain name!

If you are curious about the topic, you can read
[our article](https://help.front-commerce.com/en/articles/6618841-migrate-from-gitlab-com-to-blackswift-cloud)
