## Magento 2.3.5 and <abbr title="Multiple Source Inventory">MSI</abbr> Support

While already compatible with Magento 2.3.5, one feature wasn't supported in
Front-Commerce 2.0. Front-Commerce 2.1 is now fully compatible with
[MSI](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/inventory-management.html).
Our Magento2 extension has been updated to provide compatibility with MSI for
stores having MSI modules enabled and remains compatible with stores without
them or previous Magento versions.

## Magento2 configurations

Front-Commerce behavior is now administrable from Magento's admin area, which
opens new opportunities for your application. While it was possible to fetch
configurations from Magento2 in GraphQL, this release allow to easily expose and
reuse any Magento configurations in GraphQL.

This implementation is also more performant than using Magento2 GraphQL
implementation, thanks to caching mechanisms. Please refer to
[Using Magento Configuration](/docs/2.x/magento2/using-magento-configuration)
for further information.

## Magento2 Admin Detection

Another feature to improve Magento administrators daily work. It is now possible
to detect in Front-Commerce that an user browsing the shop is an admin logged in
Magento. You can start developing features targeting administrators. This is a
first step towards a wide range of exciting features that will be delivered in
future releases.

Please refer to [Detect admin users](/docs/2.x/magento2/detect-admin-users) for
more details.

## New Magento2 payment methods

Front-Commerce for Magento2 now supports **Affirm payments**, embedded in the
checkout page to reduce payment friction and deliver a great checkout
experience. This integration is production ready. A **developer preview of Adyen
Magento2 integration** is also available in this release. It will be
production-ready in an upcoming version.

These new payment methods considerably increase the range of solutions available
to accept payments in Front-Commerce. Our documentation has been updated with
[a new section about Payments in Front-Commerce](/docs/2.x/category/payments),
go read it!

## Translation improvements

Previously, the translation mechanism only accepted a main language (`fr`, `en`,
...). It is now possible to declare more fine-grained locales per country
(`fr-FR`, `en-US`, `en-GB`, ...) while having common language definitions for
shared translations.

Front-Commerce now supports translations for "technical pages" such as the
maintenance, offline or server error pages.

This release also reworked the way translation messages were packaged in the
Javascript bundle to reduce the size downloaded by visitors. **It improves the
overall web performance.**

## Other changes

- we've improved the development server to reduce the amount of error messages
  and be more memory efficient (it may be a good first step towards reducing
  memory consumption in dev mode)
- reduce the bundle size by improving polyfills detection and imports so they
  are only loaded for old browsers which need it
- it is now possible to invalidate the cache in a single HTTP call by batching
  invalidations
- cookies improvement: only set `SameSite=none` when secure mode in development
- fix a loading state for Paypal payments
