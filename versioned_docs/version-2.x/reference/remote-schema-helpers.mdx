We encourage you to learn more about
[Remote GraphQL modules](/docs/2.x/reference/graphql-module-definition#executor-optional)
before reading this page.

## `makeExecutor`

While one can create their own executors from scratch by following
[Creating an executor](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/remote-schemas/#creating-an-executor),
we have created `server/core/graphql/makeExecutor` with sane defaults.

It will create an executor that will:

- prepare the fetcher to query a GraphQL schema using the POST method
- log errors coming from the remote schema using winston
- forward the client IP to ensure better logging on the remote service

The `makeExecutor` takes two parameters:

- `uri` (`string | (graphQLExecutionInfo) => string`): The URI where the Remote
  GraphQL schema lives. It can either be a string or a function if the URI can
  change based on the user's request (ex: language, store id, etc.)
- `options` (`object`): An optional object containing the following keys:
  - `fetcher` optional: The fetcher used to execute the request. By default it
    is `isomorphic-fetch`
  - `fetchOptionsAdapter` optional (`(fetchOptions) => fetchOptions`):
    transforms the options passed to the `fetcher` when executing the request
  - `logger` optional: The logger used to display fetch warnings (DX messages
    meant to catch errors early). This is not likely to be used in your case. By
    default it's the common logger used in Front-Commerce.

The result should be used in a GraphQL module in
[`remoteSchema.executor`](/docs/2.x/reference/graphql-module-definition#executor-optional).
