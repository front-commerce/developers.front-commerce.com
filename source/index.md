  <h2>What is Front-Commerce?</h2>

      <h3>A React Application</h3>
      <p>You want to provide your users a better shopping experience. We give you the means to do so by setting up for you a base theme using modern technologies (React, Apollo, Webpack, Storybook, etc.). You can then extend this theme to adapt it to your most specific needs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="/images/graphql-logo.svg" />
      <h3>A GraphQL Server</h3>
      <p>Leverage GraphQL to expose your data easily, no matter the source (CMS, eCommerce Platform, PIM, ERP, etc.). We provide you the code to launch a performant Node.js server that will expose your GraphQL schema. You will use it and extend it to build a fast and modern website no matter your backend(s).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="/images/production-ready-logo.svg" />
      <h3>It is production ready!</h3>
      <p>Started in 2015, Front-Commerce is already powering shops in production. We provide all the tools needed for maintaining a deployed website: an extensive logging system (client / server errors), error boundaries, maintenance mode, SEO, internationalization, security, caching and invalidation, payments, image processing, etc.</p>

      <h2>Technologies that will benefit your users</h2>

      <p>Our goal is not to provide tools for the sake of tooling. However we strongly believe that a good set of tools will make your life easier and will enable you to do what is best for your users.</p>

      <p>Because each brand communicates differently with its customers, our goal is to let you adapt quickly and efficiently, by avoiding technical considerations that will slow you down. We stay up to date and you stay in touch with your users.</p>

  <h2>A backend agnostic solution</h2>

  <p>Even though we built Front-Commerce by integrating it with Magento 2, we had a clear vision of introducing a clean separation between the frontend and your backend solution. You will be able to use the backend that best fits your needs without rebuilding your frontend from scratch.</p>

  <p>**Magento 2 and 1 storefronts are currently running in production** (with Wordpress and / or Prismic modues). **BigCommerce is the next** one to go-live.</p>

      <h2>A Design System to improve collaboration</h2>

      <p>Front-Commerce default theme contains a Design System that helps you keep track of your brand's guidelines and look &amp; feel. It consists of a living documentation that contains the different ways you display information to your users.</p>

      <p>The web is a rich medium and the « page » metaphor for building an application is outdated. You have many channels to stay in touch with your users (newsletters, blogs, shops, etc.). Everything changes: the content, the device, its connectivity and many other things. But one thing stays: your brand and your users. By thinking in term of a Design System, you will keep your user's experience consistent. You will also be able to reuse your components accross your different channels of communication.</p>

      <p>The design system is also a the place where we will help you ensure not to introduce regressions and keep good <abbr title="Accessibility">a11y</abbr> practices.</p>

      <h2>A workflow that will improve teams efficiency</h2>

      <p>Complex projects require several teams to collaborate. Front-Commerce helps by defining clear boundaries in the system, so each team can work independently.<p>

      <p>For instance, a team can work on delivering Magento2 customization and exposing it through the WebAPI while another can set up a PIM to manage all your products data and finally your in house frontend developers can work on creating an awesome experience in the browser while your UX designers can iterate on new prototypes</p>

  <h2>A stable and secure test suite to ensure smooth upgrades</h2>

  <p>When time comes to choose a solution to build your brand’s public image for your storefront, you must take quality into consideration. New technologies are worthless if quality is left behind.</p>

  <p>We are committed to deliver code with a high level of quality, and thus are including tests at several levels. React components included in the design system have structural tests using Storyshots. Critical logic and reusable utilities also are unit tested using Jest. GraphQL resolvers are tested by using Pact.js which generates consumer contracts and ensure that the middleware works fine no matter the services you uses.</p>
