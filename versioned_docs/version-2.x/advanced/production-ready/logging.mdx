title: Setup and use logging
description:
  Front-Commerce uses the winston library for logging. This guide explains how
  to configure it and use it in your own code.

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

When you need to log something in a javascript environment, the first thing that
comes to mind is obviously `console.log`. But the issue with it is that you
won't be able access it in the long term. Especially since some Node.js server
environments don't keep a trace of the stdout/stderr of your application.

To avoid this, we're using a custom logging interface based on
[`winston`](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) (a well-known logging solution
in the Node.js ecosystem). It allows you to create a logger and configure it in
your `my-module/config/logging.js` file to send your logs to different systems.

# Use the base loggers

There are three default loggers coming with Front-Commerce:

### server logger

Reports any message sent through the default
[`winston`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) import in express routes

```js
winston.info({
  message: `Customer returned from ${methodCode} (${actionName})`,
  date: format(new Date()),
});
```

### client logger

Reports any log message from the client side

```js
import logHandler from "utils/logHandler";

logHandler.getLogger().error(e);
```

### access logger

Logs automatically any request incoming on your server

# Configure the loggers

Without configuration, a logger does nothing. You need to configure what to do
with the message reported by the different loggers.

```js title="my-module/config/logging.js"
module.exports = {
  server: [
    {
      type: "file",
      filename: "server.log",
    },
  ],
  payment: [
    {
      type: "file",
      filename: "payment.log",
    },
  ],
  client: [
    {
      type: "file",
      filename: "client.log",
    },
  ],
  access: [
    {
      type: "file",
      filename: "access.log",
    },
  ],
  security: [
    {
      type: "file",
      filename: "security.log",
    },
  ],
};
```

In this example, we've told the logging system to output every message in four
files `server.log`, `payment.log`, `client.log`, `access.log` that will be
accessible in the `logs/` folder of your application.

**But how does this work?**

In fact, the object that we exports tells the logging system that for each
logger (identified by the keys of the object), we will add an array of
[transports](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#transports).

This means that for each logger, each message will be sent using these
transports. Currently, the following types of logger transports are supported in
Front-Commerce:

- `type: "file"`: it will append the message to a file in your server's
  filesystem.  
  The only option available is `filename` which is the name of the file that
  will be put in the `logs` folder of your project.
- `type: "sentry"`: it will send the message to a sentry instance. Sentry is a
  tool that will make it easier to triage errors and assign some of your team
  members to their resolution.  
  The only option available is `options` which is the object given to the
  transport lib
  [winston-sentry-log](https://github.com/franciscofsales/winston-sentry-log#readme)
- `type: "console"`: it will send the message to stdout/stderr. This is intended
  for customers that already have a log collection system (centralized logging
  for kubernetes or a cloud platform).
- `type: "custom"`: You can provide your own `winston.transports` configuration
  within the `transport` attribute. This is intended for customers that need
  more control on the logging strategies.

# Add a new logger

Splitting your messages in the four default loggers (`access`, `client`,
`server`, `payment`) might be enough. But in some cases, you may want to move
the messages into another logger to make it either to follow what happens for a
specific feature.

:::info Important

The new loggers you will create are only available server side. If you need to
use this logger from the client side, you will need to either create a GraphQL
mutation or a custom HTTP endpoint. This will allow the client to send a message
to the server which will then be able to log it.

<!-- TODO links to GraphQL Mutation + HTTP Endpoint -->

:::

To do so, you can add a new custom logger

```js title="my-module/config/logging.js"
module.exports = {
  // ... the rest of your logger configuration
  // highlight-start
  myLoggerName: [
    {
      type: "file",
      filename: "server.log",
    },
  ],
  // highlight-end
};
```

By doing this, you've configured your logger. But you still need to use it by
importing the `loggingService` that will let you create the logger.

```js
import loggingService from "server/core/logs/loggingService";

const logger = loggingService.createLogger("myLoggerName");
```

This will then be used just like the
[winston API](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#using-logging-levels):
`logger.log(type, message, data)`.

# Log to the console

You can redirect all your logs to the console with the following code

```js title="my-module/config/logging.js"
module.exports = {
  server: [
    {
      type: "console",
    },
  ],
  payment: [
    {
      type: "console",
    },
  ],
  client: [
    {
      type: "console",
    },
  ],
  access: [
    {
      type: "console",
    },
  ],
  security: [
    {
      type: "console",
    },
  ],
};
```

## Automatic logging configuration

You can also automate the logging configuration based on whether the application
is deployed on our cloud offer (V2) or not using the following
`my-module/config/logging.js`

```js
const makeLogAccordingToEnv = (filename) =>
  process.env.FRONT_COMMERCE_CLOUD_VERSION === "2"
    ? { type: "console" }
    : { type: "file", filename };

module.exports = {
  server: [makeLogAccordingToEnv("server.log")],
  client: [makeLogAccordingToEnv("client.log")],
  access: [makeLogAccordingToEnv("access.log")],
  payment: [makeLogAccordingToEnv("payment.log")],
  security: [makeLogAccordingToEnv("security.log")],
};
```

# Custom logger implementation

You can implement a custom logger like the following example

```js title="my-module/config/logging.js"
// highlight-start
const winston = require("winston");

// highlight-end
module.exports = {
  server: [
    // highlight-start
    {
      type: "custom",
      transport: new winston.transports.Console({
        format: winston.format.simple(),
      }),
    },
    // highlight-end
  ],
};
```
