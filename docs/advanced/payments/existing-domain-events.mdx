# Payment events

The payment mechanism relies on Payment events to broadcast payment status
changes and make possible to maintain a consistent state in a remote system with
an event listener. For instance, an eCommerce integration can implement an event
listeners responsible for updating the order status depending on the payment
status.

Note: each event is based on a `PurchaseIdentifier` allowing Front-Commerce to
retrieve the related order based on either an orderId or the cartId that was
used before the order creation.

## The paymentData attribute

Most events allows you to provide custom, optional and arbitrary `paymentData`
values. These values may contain data specific to the payment platform. We
recommend that event listeners push these information to remote systems as they
usually can be helpful for further processing (e.g: synchronizing a headless
eCommerce platform with an ERP)

Example: Front-Commerce Magento's integration, will append this `paymentData` as
a JSON payload to the order history comment message.
