Starting from scratch is always exciting for a developer!

Creating new Front-Commerce projects quickly has endless advantages: build a
minimal reproduction case for reporting issues, quickly test solutions, explain
concepts to colleagues, or prototype for potential customers.

In this article we‚Äôll explain how we made this process as smooth as possible, so
you could start from a fresh, minimal state within seconds.

We're publishing a new article every day until December 24th. **Stay tuned!**

:::

## The importance of a starting point

When we started working on Front-Commerce, we wanted to make sure that starting
a new project would be as easy as possible.<br /> **We made a deliberate choice
to offer a "starter" project** containing all the essential boilerplate code
needed to launch a fully functional Front-Commerce application locally.

The maintenance of this project presents several challenges, which may not be
immediately apparent:

- have a good DX (this is the first impression newcomers will have of
  Front-Commerce),
- keep it up-to-date with the latest versions of Front-Commerce and
  dependencies,
- find the right balance (amount of code) between
  - a good starting point with many examples for newcomers,
  - as minimal as possible so new long-term projects don't have to remove
    unnecessary code.
- convenient to use in different scenarios (workshops, demos, examples,
  reproduction cases, etc.)

## 2.x: with the `skeleton` repository

In Front-Commerce 2.x, we have introduced a
[`skeleton`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce-skeleton)
repository, which serves as a foundational Front-Commerce project pre-configured
for a Magento2 setup.

Developers can clone the git repository, update specific configurations with
their Magento2 instance information, and they are good to go!<br />For
connecting a different stack, additional changes are required. _Read our
[2.x installation guide](/docs/2.x/essentials/installation) for the exact
steps._

Recognizing the need for **tangible and actionable examples**,
[we have launched a new `examples` repository.](https://github.com/front-commerce/examples)<br />
These example modules can be seamlessly integrated into a Front-Commerce's
skeleton project, demonstrating practical applications of concepts outlined in
our documentation.

The use of the `skeleton` and `examples` repositories has become increasingly
prevalent in our support activities, offering a more effective means of
illustrating concepts through concrete examples.<br /> This approach has also
proven to be more user-friendly and has evolved into a mechanism for generating
**short-lived reproduction cases when reporting a bug**.

:::note Aside: our internal `demos` repository

Internally, we also have a `demos` repository, which contains the configurations
and modules used for all our public demos (Magento2, Adobe B2B, Magento1 and
BigCommerce).<br /> The demos you can find on our website are actually skeletons
configured with content from this repository. For instance, our Magento2 demo
uses our Contentful (CMS), Cloudinary (Images) and Lyra (Payment) modules.<br />
With some workarounds, **we can deploy a preview demo on each of our Merge
Request** on Front-Commerce Cloud, to ensure that a feature or a bugfix is
working as expected ‚Ä¶ so we're also big users of our skeleton!

:::

## 3.x: with the `create-remix` CLI command

In Front-Commerce 3.x, we have reevaluated and redefined our approach, driven by
two primary objectives:

1. **Simplified project initiation**: it should take less than 30 seconds to
   start a new project from scratch, with a minimal configuration
2. **Unified use cases**: we want to use a consistent process for both our
   internal use cases and our users, unifying the experience across the board.

### Front-Commerce's skeleton is a Remix Stack

Front-Commerce 3.x is built on [Remix](https://remix.run/), you know this!<br />
Remix is a framework that provides
[a CLI command to create new projects](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/other-api/create-remix#create-remix),
called `create-remix`.

Naturally we decided to embrace the Remix way of doing things, and we turned our
skeleton into a _Remix Stack_.<br /> A Remix Stack is a Remix project that can
be used as a **template for `create-remix`**.

Launching a new Front-Commerce 3.x project from scratch should be as
straightforward as running:

```bash
npx create-remix hello-front-commerce --template https://new.front-commerce.app/
# or with pnpm
pnpm dlx create-remix hello-front-commerce --template https://new.front-commerce.app/
```

**Please follow our detailed
[Installation page](/docs/3.x/get-started/installation)** if you want to try it
out.

:::info Transition period

We're currently in a transition period, where we still are using some
`@front-commerce/compat` packages in our default theme.<br /> For this reason,
the `create-remix` command must be prefixed with
`NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS=true` at the date of writing.

:::

### A "minimal" mode

For technical reasons (and design flaws), it was not possible to start a
Front-Commerce application without a remote service in 2.x.<br /> We reworked
our core to make it possible in 3.x. We call this mode the "minimal" mode, as it
doesn't require any remote service.

This mode is **perfect for evaluation purposes, workshops, and for creating
reproduction cases when reporting an issue or testing an idea**.

Technically, a "minimal" Front-Commerce application is an application with a
single extension: `@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine`.

### The `skeleton` is now part of Front-Commerce's repository

If you want to find the code of our skeleton, you can find it
[in our main repository](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/main/skeleton?ref_type=heads).

We decided to move it there for several reasons:

- it's easier for us to maintain, as its code can be updated in the same
  changeset as Front-Commerce's code
- it allows us to use the same code than our users when working on core features
- it makes our core repository a standard Front-Commerce project repository,
  deployable on Front-Commerce Cloud without any special treatment

It has no impact whatsoever on our users, but we find it interesting to share
this information with you: we're dogfooding our own product in a better way now!
üòâ

### Examples and demos are also part of the skeleton

:::info Feedback wanted

We're still not sure about this one, and we'd love to have your feedback on this
move.

:::

As of writing, we have reorganized the code for our demos under the skeleton
directory, and a similar transition is underway for our examples.

In Front-Commerce 3.x, a notable feature is **the ability to package everything
as an extension**. Leveraging this functionality, we have encapsulated our
examples and demos as extensions, housed in the `./example-extensions`
subdirectory of the skeleton.

When initiating a new project, you can enable any of these extension by
registering them in the `front-commerce.config.ts` file.<br /> For those
embarking on a new "long-term" project, the extra-step of removing the
`./example-extensions` directory will set you on the right path.

Our rationale behind this approach is that the ability to swiftly run a demo or
example locally far outweighs the trade-off of having additional code in the
skeleton.

## What‚Äôs next?

We're still working on improving the experience of starting a new project, and
want to ensure that it fits **your use cases**.

In the pipeline, we are gearing up to introduce the following changes:

- an installation CLI with prompts to help you configure it initially (register
  and install the extensions you want to use, populate the `.env` file, etc.)
- migration of all our examples to Front-Commerce 3.x.
- increased utilization of minimal reproduction cases during support
  interactions.

‚ùì **We would greatly appreciate your input on the following:**

- what additions would you like to see in the skeleton?
- how can we further reduce friction in your daily use cases?
- are you interested in a "Fake store" extension that populates your local
  storefront with sample products, categories, etc.?
