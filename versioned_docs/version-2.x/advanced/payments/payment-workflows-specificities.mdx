title: Payment workflows specificities
description:
  Front-Commerce provides different hooks allowing you to use the payment method
  of your choice. This section explains the implementation specificities of
  payment workflows.
---

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

:::note

The documentation here only explains changes to apply to the default
implementation example for each workflow.

- See [the basic implementation tutorial](./custom-payment-method.mdx) for a
  detailed implementation
- See [the high-level workflow explanation](./payment-workflows.mdx) to choose
  the right implementation for your usecase.

:::

## Async Order

This workflow is recommended for payments that are fully front-end (e.g.
Payzen/Lyra, Paypal)

### Server changes

Ensure the direct payment processor call does nothing in the module’s
[`contextEnhancer`](/docs/2.x/reference/graphql-module-definition#contextenhancer-optional)

```diff
export default {
  namespace: "Payments/PWAy",
  dependencies: ["Magento2/Checkout", "Front-Commerce/Payment"],
  contextEnhancer: ({ loaders }) => {
    ...
    loaders.Payment.registerEmbeddedPaymentMethod(
      METHOD_CODE,
      METHOD_TITLE,
-      (paymentData, orderId, orderPaymentDetails) => {
-        return loader.order(paymentData, orderId, orderPaymentDetails);
-      },
+      () => {
+        throw new Error(
+          "The payment method should only be handled by IPN notifications"
+        );
+      },
      null,
      new MyPaymentNotificationProcessor(hipayConfig)
    );

    return {}; // you may export loaders here in case the payment provides custom Queries (to fetch a payment token for instance)
  },
};
```

:::note

This implies the `order` method in the module’s loader is not needed for this
method (your may need to implement other methods instead to be used by the
`NotificationProcessor`)

```diff
export default class MyPaymentLoader {
-  async order(paymentData, orderId, orderPaymentDetails) {
-    ...
-  }
}
```

:::

### Theme changes

Override `web/theme/pages/Checkout/checkoutFlowOf.js` to indicate the use of the
`asyncOrder` workflow for the `pway_awesomecheckout` method code

```diff
const checkoutFlowOf = (method) => {
  ...
+  if (method === "pway_awesomecheckout") return "asyncOrder";

  return "directOrder";
};

export default checkoutFlowOf;
```

## Direct Order

A direct order handles directly the payment on `onAuthorize` call in the
CustomComponent you created
(`my-module/web/theme/modules/CustomComponent/CustomComponent.js`)

This `onAuthorize` call will provide the information to the `loader.order(...)`
implemented server-side. This last method is responsible to handle the full
payment process.

### Sub workflow : Direct Order with additional action

You may need to handle a second payment step with a Direct order workflow (3DS
validation, etc).

In this case, perform the following steps

1. Reference the payment workflow

Override `src/web/theme/pages/Checkout/checkoutFlowOf.js` to indicate the use of
`directOrderWithAdditionalAction`

```diff
const checkoutFlowOf = (method) => {
  ...
+  if (method === "pway_awesomecheckout") return "directOrderWithAdditionalAction";

  return "directOrder";
};

export default checkoutFlowOf;
```

2. Create and additional action component to handle the

```js title="my-module/web/theme/AdditionalAction/MyAdditionalAction.js"
import React from "react";
import { useQuery } from "react-apollo";
import AdyenPaymentStatusQuery from "./AdyenPaymentStatusQuery.gql";
import AdyenPaymentAction from "theme/modules/Adyen/AdyenPaymentAction";

import TitledCard from "theme/components/molecules/Card/TitledCard";
import { defineMessages, FormattedMessage, useIntl } from "react-intl";
import LoadingArea from "theme/components/molecules/LoadingArea";

const MyAdditionalAction = ({ onOrderPlacedArgs, originalOnOrderPlaced }) => {
  const intl = useIntl();
  const orderId = onOrderPlacedArgs[0];

  // call originalOnOrderPlaced() when the additionnal action is successfull

  return (...);
};

export default MyAdditionalAction;
```

3. Reference the additional action component

```js title="my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/PlaceOrder/getAdditionalActionComponent.js"
import None from "theme/modules/Checkout/PlaceOrder/AdditionalAction/None";
import MyAdditionalAction from "theme/AdditionalAction/MyAdditionalAction";

const ComponentMap = {};

const getAdditionalActionComponent = (paymentCode, paymentAdditionalData) => {
  if (paymentCode === "pway_awesomecheckout")) {
    return MyAdditionalAction;
  }
  return ComponentMap?.[paymentCode] ?? None;
};

export default getAdditionalActionComponent;
```

## Redirect Before Order

:::warning

This workflow is only supported for Magento2, please
[contact us](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com) if you need this workflow with
another backend server

:::

A redirect before order workflow allows to interact with payment providers
handling the complete payment workflow on their side.

Front-Commerce will only redirect to the payment provider and ensure the order
creation afterwards.

### Server changes

1. Register the payment method payment processor with
   `registerRedirectBeforeOrderPaymentMethod` module’s
   [`contextEnhancer`](/docs/2.x/reference/graphql-module-definition#contextenhancer-optional)

Replace the module's contextEnhancer with the following

```js
import { getCurrentShopConfig } from "server/core/config/getShopConfig";

export default {
  namespace: "Payments/PWAy",
  dependencies: ["Magento2/Checkout", "Front-Commerce/Payment"],
  contextEnhancer: ({ loaders }) => {
    const shopConfig = getCurrentShopConfig(req.config);
    const METHOD_CODE = "pway_awesomecheckout";
    const METHOD_TITLE = "PWAy";

    // [...] initialization here
    const loader = new MyPaymentLoader(shopConfig, METHOD_CODE, ...);

    loaders.Payment.registerRedirectBeforeOrderPaymentMethod(
      METHOD_CODE,
      METHOD_TITLE,
      loader,
    );

    return {}; // you may export loaders here in case the payment provides custom Queries (to fetch a payment token for instance)
  },
};
```

2. Implement the three **required** methods in the loader

```js
export default class MyPaymentLoader {
  constructor(shopConfig, methodCode, ...) {
    ...

    this.callbackUrl = `${shopConfig.url}/checkout/payment/${methodCode}`;
  }

  /**
   * @param {{paymentId: any, cart: any}} paymentData the paymentId is the paymentMethod registered previously
   * @returns {PaymentCaptured} the captured payment status
   */
  mapCartPaymentToRedirect({ paymentId, cart }) {
    return {
      url: true, // set it to true for URL redirection
      html: true, // set it to true for HTML code insertion
      value: `...?callbackUrl=${this.callbackUrl}`, // the URL or HTML code to handle the redirection to the payment provider
    }
  }

  /**
   * @param {any} data : callbackUrl query parameters
   * @returns {boolean} is the payment authorized or not, returning false will lead to the checkout cancellation
   */
  async isReturnSuccess(data) {
    return true | false;
  }

  /**
   * @typedef {object} PaymentCaptured
   * @property {string} transactionId : the transactionId from the payment provider, it allows the merchant to make the link between an order and a payment
   * @property {boolean} success :  the capture succeed
   * @property {boolean} cancel : the capture was canceled
   * NOTE : if both success and cancel are false, the capture is considered failed (throwing an error will lead to the same event)
   */
  /**
   * proceed to the payment capture in the payment provider
   * NOTE: this stage follows the order creation in Magento, you should provide the orderId to the payment provider for the transaction to be easily found by the merchant
   * @param {any} additionalData : callbackUrl query's additionalData parameter -> "https://callbackUrl?additionalData=..."
   * @param {string} orderId : magento order Id
   * @param {{ currency:string, totalInclTax: number }} paymentDetails : the currency and value of the order (please ensure the payment has the same value and currency to prevent cart hijack)
   * @returns {PaymentCaptured} the captured payment status
   */
  async capturePayment(additionalData, orderId, paymentDetails) {
    return {
      transactionId,
      success: true,
      cancel: true,
    };
  }
}
```

### Theme changes

:::warning

No AdditionalDataComponent is required for this implementation as there is no
frontend component displayed by Front-Commerce

:::

1. Reference the payment workflow

Override `src/web/theme/pages/Checkout/checkoutFlowOf.js` to indicate the use of
`redirectBeforeOrder`

```diff
const checkoutFlowOf = (method) => {
  ...
+  if (method === "pway_awesomecheckout") return "redirectBeforeOrder";

  return "directOrder";
};

export default checkoutFlowOf;
```

## Redirect After Order

:::warning

This workflow is not supported anymore, please
[contact us](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com) if you identify a usecase of
this workflow
