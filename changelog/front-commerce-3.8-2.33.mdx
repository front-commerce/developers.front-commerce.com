## Gezy major features and customer-driven improvements

As more projects go live with Front-Commerce 3.x or upgrade to the latest
versions, we've received valuable feedback from our customers. **Front-Commerce
3.8 incorporates core improvements and features to support projects with diverse
and specific requirements.**

This release marks a major milestone for our Gezy integration, introducing core
e-commerce functionalities. We're excited to announce that **you can now
confidently start a project with Front-Commerce and Gezy**, as we've implemented
essential features and are now focusing on advanced capabilities!

As always, this release includes bug fixes that enhance the overall stability,
DX and performance of the platform.

## Gezy: key features implemented

Building on the foundations laid in version 3.7, we've successfully implemented
core e-commerce functionalities for the Gezy platform. **This release provides
all the essential features to guide a visitor from browsing your catalog to
becoming a customer with their first completed order!**

We took this opportunity to enrich our GraphQL core schema with additional data
for core entities and improved our default theme to support these new features.

Our team is now focusing on advanced capabilities, including:

- Professional account management
- Sophisticated payment and shipping methods
- Custom pricing logic

Curious about how Gezy can benefit your projects? We invite you to explore its
potential. <ContactLink>Reach out to us</ContactLink> to schedule a personalized

Front-Commerce can power your next e-commerce initiative!

## Contribution Mode : enhanced Support for complex pages

As e-commerce websites grow more sophisticated, there's an increasing demand for
complex, content-rich pages. Some of our customers found technical issues with
the Contribution mode when browsing pages with numerous components from
different sources.

We've addressed this challenge in our latest release by enhancing the technical
foundation of Contribution mode. **This update allows for the creation and
display of significantly more complex pages, supporting a possibly unlimited
number of components simultaneously.**

While this update doesn't introduce new features visible to end-users, it
significantly improves the protocol used by Front-Commerce to enrich the UI with
information about the data to assist contributors in their work.

:::info Technical details

Previously, we relied on HTTP response headers to provide metadata about
displayed blocks, which had inherent limitations.

Our new implementation uses a dedicated query to the backend to retrieve this
metadata. This approach circumvents the previous constraints, ensuring that your
complex pages load correctly, even when accessed through CDNs or proxies that
might have imposed limitations on header sizes.

:::

## OpenTelemetry instrumentation

Another important improvement landed in this release. We have updated the
OpenTelemetry instrumentation to provide clearer insights into your
application's external requests. This instrumentation allows you to monitor your
system's interactions with external services to detect performance issues or
bottlenecks.

While this was already possible with Front-Commerce 2.x, we have improved the
way the instrumentation is set up to allow you to customize the way requests are
grouped and monitored.

It opens up the possibility to:

- **Customizable request grouping:** You now have the flexibility to group and
  categorize requests according to your specific monitoring needs.
- **Human-Readable service names:** Replace cryptic hostnames with intuitive,
  descriptive names for outbound requests. For example:
  - "CMS" instead of acme.content-service.com
  - "PIM" for product.example.com
  - "E-Commerce" to represent my-gezy-instance.lundimatin.biz!
- **Differentiated API Manager requests:** Easily distinguish between requests
  made to a single API Manager. For instance, separate
  `api-manager.mycompany.com/catalog` from `api-manager.mycompany.com/content`.

Read more about it in the
[Customize Outbound Requests Metrics guide](/docs/3.x/guides/customize-outbound-requests-metrics).

## Other changes

We additionally worked on changes and bug fixes across different areas of the
product. You'll find a summary of these changes below.

```mdx-code-block
<details>
  <summary><h3 className="mb-0">Features</h3></summary>
```

- **Magento1:**
  - we now support guest newsletter confirmation for Magento1
- **Theme:**
  - the <abbr title="Product Detail Page">PDP</abbr> now displays more details
    about the products (brand, weight, dimensions…) for platforms exposing this
    information
  - we also added support for additional SEO metadata for both products and
    categories. Their pages now define the following tags when the data is
    available:
    - `<meta name="robots" content="">`,
    - `<meta name="product:availability" content="">`,
    - `<meta name="product:retailer_item_id" content="">`
  - we implemented cleaner `ErrorBoundary` components to handle different route
    errors, read more about it in the
    [docs](/docs/3.x/guides/error-handling-for-routes)
  - we added error handling to the API fetcher and integrated error management
    within the `MiniCart` and `PaypalButton` components. `useCart` hook and
    `withCart` HOC now also expose error information.
- **DX:**
  - we introduced a `devErrorOverlay` leveraging Vite's error overlay to provide
    a better experience for detecting errors when working on the project,
    notably during hydration
  - we now export the `ResolverContext` type from `@front-commerce/core` so it
    can be used in graphql modules resolvers, as well as fakes to be used in
    tests.
- **Core:**
  - we now expose `@front-commerce/remix/vite/vmod.mjs` as a public API to allow
    reuse in custom servers
  - we now expose a `isLoggedIn` property in the `UserJourney` to have a
    platform agnostic way to check if the user is logged in.

  <summary><h3 className="mb-0">Bug Fixes</h3></summary>
```

_These bug fixes were also backported to `2.x` when relevant._

- **Cache:**
  - we fixed a regression preventing custom strategies from being registered
    since 3.4
  - we fixed fatal errors during cache invalidation for projects using the
    `PerMagentoCustomerGroup` cache strategy
- **Magento2:**

  - we fixed an issue in guest checkout paid using paypal, payzen or stripe. We
    now use the platform agnostic `currentBillingAddress` field, instead of
    `billing_address` in payment modules, to ensure that the correct address is
    used for the payment.

- **Routes:**
  - we fixed an issue where app folder route overrides would have a full path
    when a layout route exists in an extension, and ensured that routes defined
    in `/app/routes` can also use layouts from extension or config based routes.
  - we now properly detect when the user is logged in to redirect them to the
    `/login` route when accessing the `/register` route
- **Theme:**

  - we fixed an issue where PWA manifest couldn't be accessed when the app is
    behind a Basic Auth
  - we fixed several issues with the `Slider` component to prevent rendering
    bugs and inconsistencies when going back through the slides
  - we fixed a hydration issue when using the Wysiwyg due to `Date.now` and
    `Math.random` being different on SSR and CSR. We now use
    [`useId`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId) from react to ensure a
    stable id between server and client.
  - the `renderChildNodes` are now memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
    and potential infinite loops. This change ensures that when
    `renderChildNodes` is used outside of a memoized context, it doesn't create
    new component types on each render, improving performance and stability.
  - image preload link now uses `fetchPriority` instead of `fetchpriority` to
    follow
    [React 18's requirements](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/25927)

- **GraphQL:**
  - we introduced a new custom GraphQL Date scalar to allow developers to use a
    Date object or a String as a date in GraphQL queries
  - we now handle errors in GraphQL module runtimes more gracefully. Previously
    if the loading of a GraphQL module runtime failed, the server would crash.
    Now it will log the error and continue in development mode, while it will
    crash in production.
- **Magento:**

  - `/media` routes now honors the `FRONT_COMMERCE_BACKEND_IGNORE_CACHE_REGEX`
    configuration
  - we fixed the WYSIWYG parsing logic to ship valid HTML code from invalid
    Magento's HTML. It now converts widget shortcodes wrapped in `<p>` tags to
    `<div>` tags. Magento automatically wraps widgets in `<p>` tags which
    results in invalid HTML in the WYSIWYG editor, which caused hydration errors
    in React >= 17.

- **TwicPics**
  - we fixed an issue to prevent TwicPics images from being transformed with
    incorrect proportions
  - we also fixed an issue where TwicPics images could be blurry
