## Front-Commerce payments improved

[Front-Commerce payments](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/front-commerce-payments)
is a core feature used by every platform-agnostic payment method to hook into
eCommerce platform’s checkout and order management systems.

We reworked this area of our product to enable new exciting use-cases:

- payment methods can now handle asynchronous notifications in a homogeneous way
- it is also possible to update an Order status in a more fine-grained way.
  Merchants will have more insight into the payment status from their
  back-office, no matter the payment scenario (even the more complex ones).
- payment logs are now very detailed and easier to analyze. Integrators can
  inspect any domain event that occurred and understand what customers did
  during their payment process

In the future, we will leverage these new capabilities in all our existing
payment modules.

## Adyen support

Available for Magento 2 since Front-Commerce 2.3, Adyen is now available as a
Front-Commerce payment method. It means that it can be enabled for any eCommerce
backend, without requiring a platform specific extension.

It leverages the new Front-Commerce payment improvements to provide a seamless
checkout experience.

## Prismic enhancements: peak traffic scalability and multi-environment workflows

Shops that heavily rely on Prismic to compose pages and layouts **can now
support 50x more simultaneous users than in the previous release**. Our
performance benchmarks highlighted a bottleneck due to our usage of the Prismic
API in case of peak traffic. In this release, we worked on our Prismic module to
make it leverage Front-Commerce caching mechanisms for every piece of content.

**Sharing an actively updated Prismic repository** across several Front-Commerce
environments (production, staging, development) is more convenient in this
release. An environment will now fetch the latest Prismic content version
regularly (or upon error) without relying on Prismic webhooks. Integrators gave
us feedback from their usage of the Prismic module “in a real-world scenario”.
We listened and improved the Prismic module to ensure that development and
testing remains as smooth as possible in this context.

## Proximis connector is moving fast + live event in Paris (not virtual!)

We made significant progress on the Proximis connector during this release.

If you’re a retailer wondering whether headless is a good fit for your business,
join us in Paris on the 21st of September… and be one of the first to discover
what we’ve been up to!
