title: Cache control and CDN
description:
  Enabling CDN or reverse-proxy caching improves your storefront web
  performance. During traffic peaks, it drastically reduces the server load too.
  This guide explains all the tools at your disposal to implement a totally
  custom, fine-grained caching strategy in Front-Commerce.

To enable CDN or reverse-proxy caching you first need to ensure that your site
sends proper
[HTTP cache headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control)
to visitors.

In Front-Commerce we have implemented a mechanism where you can easily set up
the `cache-control` headers for different parts of your site. You can also
provide a custom implementation of the `cache-control` if needed (e.g. products
with old last modified have longer caching duration).

Implementing a totally custom, fine-grained caching strategy is a matter of
compromise: the freshness of data vs performance. It is **NOT** something that
Front-Commerce can do by default because every context is important. We
recommend that you spend time understanding this Front-Commerce feature and
update your application accordingly.

:::info Important

Caching is disabled by default for user related content and for cart related
content. This is done to avoid inadvertently caching sensitive user information.

In practice, for any page using `Order`, `Cart` or `Wishlist` types or a non
anonymous `Customer` from the Graph, the HTTP cache will be disabled. To get
useful information on that topic, you can start Front-Commerce with
`DEBUG=front-commerce:cache`.

## Preface

In Front-Commerce we support the `s-maxage` and the `stale-while-revalidate`
cache control headers:

- The `s-maxage` header is used to instruct the CDN or reverse-proxy the time it
  can serve the cached response directly from cache without revalidating.

- The `stale-while-revalidate` header is used to instruct the CDN or
  reverse-proxy that after the `s-maxage` have passed how long can it still
  serve from the cache while at the same time revalidating its cache.

For example if `s-maxage` is 60 seconds and `stale-while-revalidate` is 10
minutes, it means that once a resource is cached, the CDN/reverse-proxy can
serve it from cache for one minute without even validating with the server, and
after 60 seconds and before 10 minutes any request to the resource will:

- be served from cache
- at the same time the resource will be requested from the server
- the cache will be updated in the background
- the validity of the resource would be reset

However if 10 minutes pass without the resource being revalidated, the next
request to the resource will not be served from the cache but will be requested
from the server directly.

In this example, the longest _outdated_ data can be served to the user is **11
minutes (60sec + 10min)**. For more information on the subject please refer to
[Keeping things fresh with stale-while-revalidate](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/)
(P.S. we use `sMaxAge` instead of `maxAge` because this is the value used by
CDNs/reverse-proxies)

## Dynamic Pages

The default theme already contains specific fragments that you can override to
customize Cache-Control settings for the most common pages. Please look for the
`*CacheControlFragment.gql` files across the theme. Override the desired
`*CacheControlFragment.gql` file. Then uncomment the `cacheControl` part of the
query. Finally set the `sMaxAge` and `staleWhileRevalidate` values to meet your
requirements. For example the `CategoryCacheControlFragment.gql` could look
something like this:

```graphql
fragment CategoryCacheControlFragment on Category {
  cacheControl(input: { sMaxAge: 600, staleWhileRevalidate: 3600 }) {
    sMaxAge
    staleWhileRevalidate
  }
}
```

P.S. we use `sMaxAge` instead of `maxAge` because this is the value used by
shared caches (e.g. reverse proxies or CDN)

## Static Pages

To set up cache control headers for static pages you need to set a static
attribute on the matching route component. Please make sure that this attribute
is hoisted all the way to be visible on the exported route component. Your
static page component should look something like this:

```jsx
import Home from "theme/pages/Home";

Home.cacheControlDefinition = {
  sMaxAge: 10,
  staleWhileRevalidate: 1000,
};

export default Home;
```

## GraphQL queries

To enable caching for GraphQL queries you should make your GraphQL queries use
the `GET` method. This can be done by adding the following environment variable
to your `.env` file:

```shell
FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_USE_GET_FOR_PERSISTED_QUERIES=true
```

Once you have enabled `GET` for your GraphQL queries the dispatcher will
automatically set the values for the `cache-control` header based on the
`cacheControl` fields contained in your GraphQL query.

:::note

setting `FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_USE_GET_FOR_PERSISTED_QUERIES=true` will disable
GraphQL query batching.

:::

## CDN or Reverse proxy configuration

Finally after you have set up the appropriate cache controls for your site you
now need to configure a CDN (or a reverse proxy such as Nginx) which will take
care of caching pages for users. See
[Which CDN providers support stale-while-revalidate?](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/cdn-rfc5861-support.html)
for a list of CDN that supports it. As of 2.6, Front-Commerce requires that the
CDN ignores the cache for requests containing a cookie named `connect.sid`.
Please refer to your CDN's documentation for more details. **If you are using
Front-Commerce Cloud, you have nothing to do** unless you changed default
values. Please <ContactLink /> if you need support to enable caching.

## Advanced usage

### Customize cache headers per category/product/CMS page

You can have a more fine grained control on your cache headers' configurations
than the one presented [in the Dynamic Pages above](#dynamic-pages). This can be
done in the resolver/loader of the module itself.

For example let us have a look at the resolver of the Magento 2 Categories found
at `src/server/modules/magento2/catalog/categories/resolvers.js`. You can see a
section there dedicated to cache control. It is there that you can add any logic
you want to tweak the cache control headers to your liking depending on the
category at hand. Note we recommend you write the logic in the loader and call
it from the resolver as with any other function.

### Implementing cache control for your custom module

Say you have a custom module and you want to add caching capabilities to your
module. In Front-Commerce this is possible by implementing the `Cacheable`
GraphQL interface and adding the `cacheControl` field to your module's resolver.
Lets see how CmsPage schema and resolver has been updated:

```diff title="my-module/server/cms/schema.gql"
-type CmsPage implements Sitemapable & Routable {
+type CmsPage implements Sitemapable & Routable & Cacheable {
  "The Page's identifier"
  identifier: String
  "The Page's title"
  title: String
  "The Page's content"
  content: String
  # ...
+  cacheControl(input: CacheControlInput): CacheControlDefinition
}
```

```js title="my-module/server/cms/resolver.js"
export default {
  ...
  CmsPage: {
    path: ({ identifier }) => `/` + identifier,
    priority: () => 0.25,
    ...
    // highlight-start
    cacheControl: (_, { input: cacheControlDefinition }, { loaders }) => {
      return loaders.CacheControl.loadDefaultCacheControl(
        cacheControlDefinition
      );
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
  ...
};
```

You also need to make sure that from the client side the `cacheControl` field is
requested by your GraphQL query related to your custom module, and is set up
with proper values. Lets see how `MatchUrls` query has been updated:

```graphql title="my-module/web/theme/modules/Router/DispatcherQuery.gql"
#import "theme/pages/Product/ProductFragment.gql"
#import "theme/pages/Category/CategoryFragment.gql"
#import "theme/pages/CmsPage/CmsPageFragment.gql"
// highlight-start
#import "theme/pages/Product/ProductCacheControlFragment.gql"
#import "theme/pages/Category/CategoryCacheControlFragment.gql"
#import "theme/pages/CmsPage/CmsPageCacheControlFragment.gql"
// highlight-end

query MatchUrls($url: String!, $params: QueryInput) {
  route(url: $url) {
    path
    __typename
    ... on RedirectEntity {
      redirectTo
      redirectType
    }
    ... on Product {
      ...ProductFragment
      // highlight-next-line
      ...ProductCacheControlFragment
    }
    ... on Category {
      ...CategoryFragment
      // highlight-next-line
      ...CategoryCacheControlFragment
    }
    ... on CmsPage {
      ...CmsPageFragment
      // highlight-next-line
      ...CmsPageCacheControlFragment
    }
  }
}
```
