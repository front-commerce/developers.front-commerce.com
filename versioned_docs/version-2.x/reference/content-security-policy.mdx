This guide explains how to setup

<abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr> in your [config/website.js configuration](/docs/2.x/reference/configurations#configwebsitejs).

## Basic configuration

For security reasons only URLs from the store's domain are authorized through
CSP. However, for tracking and third-party dependencies, you will have to
authorize more domains. Use the following config and add your custom domain in
each:

```js title="my-module/config/website.js"
{
  ...
  // highlight-start
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      scriptSrc: [],
      frameSrc: [],
      styleSrc: [],
      imgSrc: [],
      fontSrc: [],
      connectSrc: [],
      baseUri: []
    }
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

When a CSP is missing, your browser will let you know in its console and log it
using the `security` logger.

## Enable Report-Only

:::warning Loose security policies

This chapter implies lowering the security of your application, please fully
consider your needs before using this feature.

:::

If you are unable to define a restricted list of content providers, you may need
to enable all contents of a kind.

This will allow all content of a kind and log violation to your configuration
**without** blocking the contents.

In the example below, all frames will be allowed and frames not originating from
the domain itself or `mysite.com` will be logged in the `security` logger.

```js title="my-module/config/website.js"
{
  ...
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      scriptSrc: [],
      frameSrc: ["*.mysite.com"],
      styleSrc: [],
      imgSrc: [],
      fontSrc: [],
      connectSrc: [],
      baseUri: []
    },
    // highlight-start
    reportOnlyDirectives: {
      frameSrc: true,
    }
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```
