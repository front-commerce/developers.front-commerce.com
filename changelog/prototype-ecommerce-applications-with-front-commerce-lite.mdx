## Why Front-Commerce Lite?

We are on a mission to improve web quality and shopping experience on eCommerce
stores. Hence [our vision](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/welcome)
is to provide a product that contains all the best practices for building
qualitative online stores, so teams can stay focused on what is relevant to
their context.

One of the most frequent feedback we have from developers and teams when
introducing Front-Commerce is:

> Your product looks neat! Could we start playing with it, in order to (insert a
> totally valid reason here)?

We want you to understand the philosophy and the power of the technologies and
architecture principles we chose. **In our opinion code is the best way to do
it!**

Front-Commerce Lite is just that: a simpler version of Front-Commerce. It uses
the same libraries and follows the same principles and conventions. A direct
consequence is that our documentation works for both Front-Commerce and
Front-Commerce Lite. And it is open source!

## Why should I care?

You may sooner or later be wondering what product you should use to build your
next project. **We believe Front-Commerce has some serious advantages over other
products out there (or soon-to-be)**, and the stores already in production with
the current Front-Commerce codebase prove it!

Front-Commerce Lite can help you to get a taste of what choosing Front-Commerce
could bring for you, your team, your company and your customers. Here are some
ideas about what you could do with this open source version:

- start learning new technologies and concepts,
- experiment an idea with your team,
- evaluate Front-Commerce,
- convince your boss,
- or win projects by building a <abbr title="Proof of Concept">PoC</abbr>.

Because of its maturity, Front-Commerce has much more features and things that
you maybe have not yet think about. We have made some opinionated choices, and
we recommend you to read the
[What it is **NOT** section](https://github.com/front-commerce/front-commerce-lite#what-it-is-not)
of its README for more details.

## How do I get started?

Take a 15 minutes slot and run the following commands:

1.  `git clone git@github.com:front-commerce/front-commerce-lite.git`
2.  `cd front-commerce-lite && npm install`
3.  `npm start`
4.  open your favorite editor and start coding!

In case you want to understand step by step what is happening or if you
encounter difficulties to install or launch the project, we are here to learn!
