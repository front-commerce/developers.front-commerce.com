:::info

Extensions are registered in the application using the
`front-commerce.config.ts` file. Read
[Register an extension](/docs/remixed/guides/register-an-extension) to learn
more.

## `defineRemixExtension`

The `defineRemixExtension` allows you to define extensions settings for a Remix
application, this extends the
[`defineExtension`](../front-commerce-core/defineExtension) configuration of
Front-Commerce.

```js
defineRemixExtension(configuration);
```

Arguments:

| Name            | Type                                            | Description                 |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `configuration` | [`RemixExtensionConfig`](#remixextensionconfig) | The extension configuration |

Example:

```js
import { defineRemixExtension } from "@front-commerce/remix";

defineRemixExtension({
  name: "acme",
  theme: "./extensions/acme/theme",
  // highlight-next-line
  routes: "extensions/acme",
});
```

## `RemixExtensionConfig`

:::info

`RemixExtensionConfig` is the definition interface of an extension, which
extends the
[`ExtensionConfig`](../front-commerce-core/defineExtension#extensionconfig)
interface.

:::

In addition to the `ExtensionConfig`, the `RemixExtensionConfig` has the
following properties:

### `routes`

**Optional** `string` |
[`routes`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/remix-config#routes)

This can either be a string which defined the base directory that contains the
routes, or the routes configuration function from Remix.

#### File based routes:

File based roots use the `flatRoutes` from Remix, which means that the
convention is the same as using the `routes` directory in a Remix application.

```js
{
  name: "acme",
  theme: "./extensions/acme/theme",
  routes: "extensions/acme",
}
```

:::caution

The `flatRoutes` from Remix requires a placeholder `root.tsx` file at the same
level as the `routes` directory.

```
extensions
└─ acme
   ├─ root.tsx
   └─ routes
      ├─ acme.tsx
      └─ index.tsx
```

:::

#### Config based routes:

```js
{
  name: "acme",
  theme: "./extensions/acme/theme",
  routes: async (defineRoutes) => {
    return defineRoutes((routes) => {
      routes.get("/acme", `../extensions/pages/acme.tsx`);
    });
  },
}
```

:::caution

Remix resolves the path to the a route file relative to the `appDirectory`,
that's why in the above example we use `../` to go back to the root directory of
the application.
