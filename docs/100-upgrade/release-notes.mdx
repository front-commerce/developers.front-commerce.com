## Semantic Versioning

We aim at releasing often and follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)
to clearly communicate our advancements to developers. We document each
migration process (changelog, release notes and documentation updates) and add
deprecation warnings while keeping backwards compatibility to keep upgrades as
seamless as possible.

**TL;DR:** (from the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) documentation)

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner,
>    and
> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
>
> Additional labels for pre-release can (and in our case will) be added to the
> MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Each supported version will receive bug fixes and security updates, leading to
regular patch releases.

## Release Schedule

We release a minor version of Front-Commerce **every 6 weeks** with new
features, tech improvements, bug fixes…

In order to follow the pace of our users, we may release intermediate
pre-releases (`-beta.x`) between 2 minor releases, to allow early-adopters to
integrate the features as soon as possible and to give us feedback.

The table below shows the exact dates of the upcoming releases and our Long Term
Support (LTS) policy.

<details>
<summary>There are three phases that a Front-Commerce release can be in: <code>Current</code>, <code>End of Support (EOS)</code>, and <code>End of Life (EOL)</code></summary>

- `Current` - Should incorporate most of the non-major (non-breaking) changes
  that land on Front-Commerce `main` branch.
- `End of Support` - While still in the `EOS` phase, the release will receive
  critical bug fixes and security updates. New features will not be added to
  `EOS` releases. The `EOS` phase will last for 1 year after the release date.
- `End of Life` - While still in the `EOL` phase, the release will receive
  critical security updates. No new features or bug fixes will be added to `EOL`
  releases. The `EOL` phase will last for 2 year after the release date.
