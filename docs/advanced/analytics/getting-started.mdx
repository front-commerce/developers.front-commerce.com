Front-Commerce uses [`analytics`](https://getanalytics.io/) under the hood. If
we represent how it works, it would look like this:

<Figure>
  <AnalyticsFigure
    aria-label="Schema explaining the concepts behind analytics"
    width="100%"
    className="text-black dark:text-white" // the lines use current color as to adabt to theme
  />
</Figure>

Across your React application, you can track events using functions such as
`trackEvent` or `trackPage`. Then, the event is dispatched to all the relevant
integrations registered in your application, learn more in the
[Tracking API](tracking-api) docs.

This means that once you have correctly configured events in your React
Components, adding new tracking services is less risky: it has no impact on what
is being tracked.

## Configure analytics

:::info

If you would like to directly jump into the code, you look at the
[common plugins](/docs/advanced/analytics/plugins#common-plugins) often used
within a Front-Commerce app.

:::

First you will need to configure your analytics by updating the
[configuration file](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/src/config/analytics.sample.js):

```js title="src/config/analytics.js"
module.exports = {
  analytics: {
    // Make sure that your analytics is enabled
    enable: true,
    // Enables the debug mode of the `analytics` library
    debug: true,
    // Pass any default settings to your plugins
    defaultSettings: {},
    // The list of plugins is defined here
    plugins: [
      {
        // The name allows to know if the user allowed to use
        // this tracking service or not, it should not be confused
        // with the name in the plugin script.
        name: "google-analytics",
        // Usually we always need to set it to true since GDPR
        needConsent: true,
        // Some integrations may have a privacy mode allowing them
        // to be enabled by default. Use this configuration to always
        // enable it. It is irrelevant if `needConsent` is `false`.
        enabledByDefault: true,
        // Settings can be an object or a function that will be called
        // with the current consent authorization from the visitor, it also
        // receive a 2nd parameter with codes of the other consents given.
        // Using a function can allow to have different settings depending
        // on the context
        settings: (authorization, otherAuthorizations) => {
          return {
            measurementIds: ["G-abc123"],
            gtagConfig: {
              anonymize_ip: !authorization,
            },
          };
        },
        // It should either return a promise function or a dynamic import to
        // the plugin script which will be added at to  the `analytics` library
        // see listed plugins: https://getanalytics.io/plugins/#supported-analytic-tools
        script: () => import("@analytics/google-analytics"),
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## GDPR consent

If your integrations need consent of the user before running, you need to setup
the `config/cookieServices.js` file. This file will let you define which cookies
and trackings services are used within your application and will let the user
chose which tracking service to allow.

```js title="config/cookieServices.js"
export default {
  default_en: [
    {
      // Category of cookies to allow the user to accept all the integrations at once in a specific category
      title: "Analytics",
      description:
        "These cookies allows us to measure the traffic on our contents and hence to improve them.",
      services: [
        {
          // The name should be the same as mentioned in the `config/analytics.js` file
          name: "google-analytics",
          title: "Google Analytics",
          // display all the cookies managed by Google Analytics
          cookies: [
            "_ga",
            "_gat",
            "_gid",
            "__utma",
            "__utmb",
            "__utmc",
            "__utmt",
            "__utmz",
          ],
          description:
            "Google Analytics cookies, from Google, are meant to gather statistics about visits.",
          link: "https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

The consent for the cookies is stored in 2 cookies:

1. `hasConsent` cookie which stores if the user provided consent answer
   (authorized or denied) for all services.
2. `authorizations` cookie which stores a JSON string of all consents given in
   the following format `{ [service_name]: true | false, ... }`

:::info Important

The expiration for these two cookies' should be configured in
[`src/config/website.js`](/docs/reference/configurations#configwebsitejs).

```js title="src/config/website.js"
module.exports = {
  default_image_url: "https://placehold.it/150x220",
  available_page_sizes: [18, 36],
  ....
  rewrittenToRoot: ["/home"],
  useUserTitles: false,
  // highlight-next-line
  cookieMaxAgeInMonths: 12,
};
```
