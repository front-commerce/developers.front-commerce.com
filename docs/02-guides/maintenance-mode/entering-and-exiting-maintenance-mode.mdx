# Maintenance Mode

You may want to put one or more of your stores in maintenance mode while you do
some maintenance work/deployment tasks on your store(s).

Front-Commerce comes with an API that allows you to put/remove a store in
maintenance mode. To enable the maintenance mode API you need to set the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN` environment variable.

```shell title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=a-secret-token
```

Once you have setup the `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN`
environment variable the maintenance mode API will be available after restarting
the server

## The Maintenance Mode API

<Steps>

<Step>

### Activating the maintenance mode

To activate the maintenance mode on a store which URL is `https://example.com/`
use the following HTTP request:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://example.com/api/maintenance-mode' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "token": "a-secret-token"
}'
```

The `token` value must match the secret defined in your application's
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN` environment variable.

It is also possible to set a duration (in milliseconds) after which the
maintenance mode will be automatically reset:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://example.com/api/maintenance-mode' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "token": "a-secret-token",
    "duration": 3600000
}'
```

Use this if you have a rough idea of how much time the maintenance task would
take or to prevent a user or automated process to forget to deactivate the
maintenance mode.

</Step>
<Step>

### Deactivating the maintenance mode

To deactivate the maintenance mode use the following HTTP request:

```shell
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://example.com/api/maintenance-mode' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "token": "a-secret-token"
}'
```

</Step>
<Step>

### To check the maintenance mode

To check the maintenance mode use the following HTTP request:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://example.com/api/maintenance-mode'
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Bypassing the maintenance mode

To bypass the maintenance mode for certain IP addresses you can configure the
`maintenance.authorizedIps` in your `front-commerce.config.ts` file.

```ts title="front-commerce.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core";

export default defineConfig({
  maintenance: {
    authorizedIps: ["127.0.0.1", "83.65.12.111", "2ce8:c427::7156:ad8e"],
  },
});
```

:::caution

Please configure **both v4 and v6** IP as much as possible.

To retrieve your IP address you can use https://www.whatismyip.com/ or via the
curl command:

```shell
$ curl ifconfig.me -6
# 2ce8:c427::7156:ad8e
$ curl ifconfig.me -4
# 83.65.12.111
```
