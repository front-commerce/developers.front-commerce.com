title: Loading data from unified GraphQL schema
description:
  Explore how to retrieve dynamic data from your application's unified GraphQL
  schema in a Front-Commerce route using Remix. This guide delves into the
  practical aspects of querying and managing data through GraphQL, demonstrating
  the setup, execution, and optimization of data requests. Understand the
  synergistic relationship between Front-Commerce and Remix, with a focus on
  leveraging GraphQL for efficient data handling and page rendering.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites in
place:

- A Front-Commerce project configured and ready to use
- Basic knowledge of [Remix routes](/docs/3.x/get-started/your-first-route)
- [FAQ GraphQL Module](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/main/skeleton/example-extensions/faq-demo/graphql)
  installed and configured if you want to execute code samples without any
  changes

## Loading Data

In your app directory, create a new route file (e.g.,
`app/routes/_main.faq.$slug.tsx`) and add the following code:

```tsx title="app/routes/_main.faq.$slug.tsx"
import { json } from "@front-commerce/remix/node";
import { useLoaderData } from "@front-commerce/remix/react";
import type { LoaderFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import FaqDetail from "theme/pages/FaqDetail";
import { isRouteErrorResponse, useRouteError } from "@remix-run/react";
import { FaqEntryQueryDocument } from "~/graphql/graphql";
import { FrontCommerceApp } from "@front-commerce/remix";

// The route exports a `loader` function that is responsible
// for fetching data and throwing errors, ensuring that
// the main component is only rendered in the "happy path".
export const loader = async ({ context, params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const { slug } = params;

  // The `loader` uses the `FrontCommerceApp` class to access the Front-Commerce
  // core from Remix. In this example, we use it to fetch data from the GraphQL
  // unified API (similar to the one you're used to).
  const app = new FrontCommerceApp(context.frontCommerce);
  const response = await app.graphql.query(FaqEntryQueryDocument, {
    input: { slug },
  });
  if (!response.faqEntry) {
    throw new Response("Question not found", { status: 404 });
  }

  return json({
    faqEntry: response.faqEntry,
  });
};

// The main component is a plain React component that receives
// the data from the loader, using Remix fetching primitives (`useLoaderData`)
// both on the server and on the client.
export default function Component() {
  const { faqEntry } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();

  return <FaqEntry entry={faqEntry} />;
}

// The route also exports an ErrorBoundary component that is responsible
// for displaying errors. It can be used to display a custom error page.
export const ErrorBoundary = () => {
  const error = useRouteError();

  if (isRouteErrorResponse(error)) {
    return <div>FAQ : question not found</div>;
  }
};
```

This is an example of a route that fetches a question from the GraphQL API and
renders it using a `<FaqDetail />` Page component (that is a plain React
component). As you can see, all the logic belongs to the route!

## Reference

As we can see here retrieving dynamic data from Front-Commerce unified GraphQL
schema can be done in a natural way from any route. But this only scratches the
surface of what you can do with Front-Commerce and Remix.

- [`loader`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader) - _Each route can
  define a "loader" function that provides data to the route when rendering._
- [`action`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/action) - _A route `action` is
  a server only function to handle data mutations and other actions. If a
  non-GET request is made to your route (`DELETE`, `PATCH`, `POST`, or `PUT`)
  then the action is called before the loaders.._
- [`Component`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/component) - _The default
  export of a route module defines the component that will render when the route
  matches._
- [`ErrorBoundary`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/error-boundary) - _A
  Remix ErrorBoundary component works just like normal React
  [error boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html), but with a
  few extra capabilities._
- [`FrontCommerceApp`](/docs/3.x/api-reference/front-commerce-remix/front-commerce-app) -
  _The FrontCommerceApp class is the main entry point to the Front-Commerce
  core. It provides access to the Front-Commerce core and to the GraphQL
  client._
