# Maintenance Mode

You may want to put one or more of your stores in maintenance mode while you do
some maintenance work/deployment tasks on your store(s).

Front-Commerce comes with an API that allows you to put/remove a store in
maintenance mode. To enable the maintenance mode API you need to set the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN` environment variable.

```shell title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=a-secret-token
```

Once you have setup the `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN`
environment variable the maintenance mode API will be available after restarting
the server

## The Maintenance Mode API

### Activating the maintenance mode

To activate the maintenance mode use the following rest request:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http(s)://www.example.com/:storeBaseUrl/maintenance-mode' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "token": string,          // the value of the "FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN" environment variable
    "duration": number | null // a number to timeout the maintenance mode in milliseconds or null to not reset maintenance mode after a timeout
}'
```

So if your store base url is `/en` the URL would be
`http(s)://www.example.com/en/maintenance-mode`.

As noted above the `duration` is optional. If used it will reset the maintenance
mode after the duration has passed. Use this if you have a rough idea of how
much time the maintenance task would take or to prevent a user or automated
process to forget to deactivate the maintenance mode.

### Deactivating the maintenance mode

To deactivate the maintenance mode use the following rest request:

```shell
curl --location --request DELETE 'http(s)://www.example.com/:storeBaseUrl/maintenance-mode' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "token": string          // the value of the "FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN" environment variable
}'
```

### To check the maintenance mode

To check the maintenance mode use the following rest request:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'http(s)://www.example.com/:storeBaseUrl/maintenance-mode'
```

## Bypassing the maintenance mode

To bypass the maintenance mode for certain IPs you can configure the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZED_IPS` environment variable. Please
note that you can have multiple IPs separated by a comma like:

```shell title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=a-secret-token
FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZED_IPS=127.0.0.1,83.65.12.111,2ce8:c427::7156:ad8e
```

:::caution

Please configure **both v4 and v6** IP as much as possible. You can retrieve
your own IP addresses with https://www.whatismyip.com/
