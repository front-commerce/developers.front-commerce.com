## Implement a new Front-Commerce Payment method

## The payment strategies

Payment can be handled synchronously or asynchronously.

If Front-Commerce allows both strategies to work, we highly recommend you to
implement an asynchronous payment method (using <abbr title="Instant Payment Notification">IPN</abbr>) whenever it is possible.

This will prevent your payments from being rejected later within the provider
process without your backend application knowing about it.

## Let’s go to the implementation (with IPN)

Front-Commerce allows you to implement your own payment method. New embedded
payment methods have to be registered from a GraphQL module. Let’s create a new
"PWAy" payment module for a fictive payment provider.

1. [create a new GraphQL module](/docs/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema#Create-a-new-GraphQL-module)
2. add a depency upon `"Magento2/Checkout"` and `"Front-Commerce/Payment"`

   ```js
   export default {
     namespace: "Payments/PWAy",
     dependencies: ["Magento2/Checkout", "Front-Commerce/Payment"],
   };
   ```

3. register the payment method from the module’s
   [`contextEnhancer`](/docs/reference/graphql-module-definition#contextenhancer-optional)

   ```js
   export default {
     namespace: "Payments/PWAy",
     dependencies: ["Magento2/Checkout", "Front-Commerce/Payment"],
     contextEnhancer: ({ loaders }) => {
       // [...] initialization here
       const loader = new MyPaymentLoader();

       const METHOD_CODE = "pway_awesomecheckout";
       const METHOD_TITLE = "PWAy";
       loaders.Payment.registerEmbeddedPaymentMethod(
         METHOD_CODE,
         METHOD_TITLE,
         // this method is called following the onAuthorize call in the AdditionalDataComponent (see below)
         // e.g. to trigger the payment authorization on the provider (validation and capture will be handled asynchronously by IPN)
         (paymentData, orderId, orderPaymentDetails) => {
           return loader.order(paymentData, orderId, orderPaymentDetails);
         },
         null,
         // The notification processor will handle IPN notifications from the payment provider
         new MyPaymentNotificationProcessor(hipayConfig)
       );

       return {}; // you may export loaders here in case the payment provides custom Queries (to fetch a payment token for instance)
     },
   };
   ```

4. implement your loader's `order` method to process a payment

```js
export default class MyPaymentLoader {
  constructor(...) {
    ...
  }

  async order(paymentData, orderId, orderPaymentDetails) {
    // process the paymentData and call the payment provider
    const paymentStatus = call(...)

    // return payment DomainEvents representing what happened in the remote payment system.
    // These events are broadcasted by Front-Commerce to the registered external event listeners
    // that can use this information to update other remote systems (e.g: adding an Order comment in Magento)
    switch(paymentStatus.status) {
      case SUCCESS:
        // as the IPN handler will handle final authorisation it is often only an authorisation at this step
        return new PaymentAuthorized(
          new PurchaseIdentifier({ orderId }),
          paymentStatus.paymentReference
        )
      case REFUSED:
        return new PaymentRefused(
          new PurchaseIdentifier({ orderId }),
          paymentStatus.reason
        )
    }
  }
}
```

5. Implement the notification processor (for IPN handling)

See
[how to implement a NotificationProcessor](./custom-notification-processor.mdx)

## Handle a sublist of payment methods

You may need to dynamically set the list of payment methods displayed for your
module.

This is achieved by registering a replacement handler

```js
export default {
  namespace: "Payments/PWAy",
  dependencies: ["Magento2/Checkout", "Front-Commerce/Payment"],
  contextEnhancer: ({ loaders }) => {
    ...
    loaders.Payment.registerEmbeddedPaymentMethod(
      ...
    );

    loaders.Payment.registerMultiplePaymentMethods({
      isMethodToReplace: (method) => method.code === METHOD_CODE,
      getReplacementMethods: async () => {
        try {
          // custom call to fetch the allowed payment methods list
          const paymentMethods = call(...);
          return paymentMethods.map((method) => ({
            // this is the method code provided to the checkout workflow
            // note that all payment methods must have a common prefix
            code: `${prefix}_${method.id}`,
            // the displayed payment method name on the checkout page
            title: method.description,
            // this method is called following the onAuthorize call in the AdditionalDataComponent (see bellow) instead of the default method defined with registerEmbeddedPaymentMethod
            callback: (paymentData, orderId, orderPaymentDetails) =>
              return loader.order(paymentData, orderId, orderPaymentDetails);
            },
        } catch (error) {
          // handle the error here
          return [];
        }
      },
    });
    ...
  },
};
```

## Display the new payment method on the UI

see [the custom payment information](./custom-payment-information) for details
on the front-end implementation of a payment method

:::note

We encourage you to investigate `payment-` modules' source code from
[Front-Commerce's core](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/main/src/server/modules)
to learn about advanced patterns.
