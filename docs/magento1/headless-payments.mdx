title: Magento1 headless payments
description:
  Historically, Magento1 does not support headless payments. Even though some
  payment providers are using APIs from their module, most of them often rely on
  the user's session to persist meaningful information across checkout steps.
  This guide explains how to expose an existing Magento payment method for
  headless usage in Front-Commerce.

Front-Commerce’s Magento module provides a generic way to expose Magento payment
modules headlessly and supports
[the relevant Front-Commerce payment workflows](/docs/advanced/payments/payment-workflows).

## Supported Payment platforms

Our Magento1 integration currently provides native adapters for the platforms
below, learn how to install each one of them from the related documentation
page:

- [Paypal](/docs/advanced/payments/paypal#Magento1-module)

:::info

If you want to use a Payment module not yet listed above, please <ContactLink />
so we can provide information about a potential upcoming native support for it.

  This section will be documented in the future. In the meantime, please
  <ContactLink /> so we can show you the steps to create your own headless payment

### Using the "redirect after order" flow

**Payment flows:**
[Redirect after order](/docs/advanced/payments/payment-workflows#Redirect-After-Order)

1. Add your own payment instance on `config.xml` file

First, you need to create your own model implementing the
`FrontCommerce_Integration_Model_Headlesspayment_Interface` interface and
register it using the
`<config><frontcommerce><payment_instances><{payment_method_code}>{class_name}</{payment_method_code}></payment_instances></frontcommerce></config>`
XML node in your `config.xml` file.

**Note:** don't forget to replace `{payment_method_code}` by your method payment
code and `{class_name}` by the class names you've just created

2. Implement the interface methods in your own model:

- `isHtml(): Boolean` if your payment return type is HTML content or not
- `isUrl(): Boolean` if your payment return type is URL or not
- `getValue(Mage_Sales_Model_Order $order): String` return URL or HTML when this
  payment method is call on front
- `getResponseSuccess(String $action, [String] $additionalData): Boolean` Failed
  or success payment action
- `getResponseMessage(String $action, [String] $additionalData): [String]`
  Failed action message
  - in success case, return an array of `quote_id` and `order_id`:
    ```js
    return [
      (int) $additionalData['quote_id'], (int)  $additionalData['order_id']
    ];
    ```
  - in case of errors, return an array of error messages:
    ```js
    return [{error message}]
    ```
- `returnAction(String $action, [String] $additionalData): Boolean` Callback
  after payment, for example, you can add your custom code here for retrieve
  customer cart after cancel payment
