title: Meta modules
description:
  We recommend keeping your GraphQL modules small and focused on a single
  feature, but having many different modules could make distribution more
  tedious. That is why Front-Commerce supports the concept of "meta modules",
  which are a way to group smaller modules.
---

If several teams are working on a project, small modules are a way to
[federate the graph implementation](https://principledgraphql.com/integrity#2-federated-implementation).
It also makes it easier to change implementations and service providers later in
the project.

For instance, you could replace a `Magento2/Cms` module with a `Wordpress/Cms`
one without impacting the web application (as long as both schemas share a
common API).

**Having a lot of different modules could make distribution more tedious**. That
is why Front-Commerce allows you to author and consume "meta modules".

## Using a meta module

**<abbr title="Too Long; Didn't Read">TL;DR</abbr>: there is no difference
between using a meta module and a _normal_ module!**

Let’s illustrate meta module by analyzing how
[Front-Commerce’s Magento2 integration](/docs/category/magento2) can be
registered in your project.

If your Front-Commerce application is aimed at being a PWA frontend for a
monolithic Magento2 instance, then it is only a one line change to get all the
features:

```js title=".front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  name: "Front-Commerce",
  url: "https://www.front-commerce.test",
  modules: [],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerceCore", path: "server/modules/front-commerce-core" },
    // highlight-next-line
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
  ],
};
```

Under the hood, it imports several GraphQL modules at once (`Magento2/Cms`,
`Magento2/Catalog`, `Magento2/Checkout`, `Magento2/Search`, etc..).

## How to define a meta module

For a module to be considered as a meta module, you need to expose a list of
submodules in the
[`modules`](/docs/reference/graphql-module-definition#modules-optional) key of
the module definition (along with the namespace).

Here is an example from Magento2 meta module definition:

```js title="node_modules/front-commerce/src/server/modules/magento2/index.js"
import Cart from "./cart";
// […]

export default {
  namespace: "Magento2",
  modules: [
    Cart,
    // […]
  ],
};
```
