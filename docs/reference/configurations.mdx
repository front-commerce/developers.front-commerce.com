title: Configurations
description:
  This reference documentation is about existing Front-Commerce configuration
  files.
---

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

:::note

Most configurations in Front-Commerce are now using
[Environment variables](/docs/reference/environment-variables) and
[Configuration providers](/docs/advanced/server/configurations). We invite you
to also read these related pages.

:::

## How to set your configurations

Each file described below exist in
[`node_modules/front-commerce/src/config`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/tree/main/src/config)
in Front-Commerce. If you want to override some, duplicate those in
`my-module/config`.

> _New in version `1.0.0-beta.3`:_ configurations are inherited across themes
> declared in your `.front-commerce.js` in a similar fashion than
> [theme overrides](/docs/essentials/extend-the-theme#understanding-theme-overrides).

:::caution Security Notice

Please keep in mind that most of these configurations are imported and bundled
into your client application. Thus it is important to not include private
configurations in them, and to use
[environment variables](/docs/reference/environment-variables#add-your-own-environment-variables)
instead.

### `config/website.js`

> _`search.attributeFacetMinimumDocumentCount` and
> `search.categoryFacetMinimumDocumentCount` have been added in Front-Commerce
> `2.3.0`. Before this version, Front-Commerce behaved as if those parameters
> were set to 1._

This configuration file should contain any thing that impacts the content of
your website. The term website refers to what a
[`website` is in Magento's ecosystem](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/multi-site/ms_over.html).

- ~~`root_categories_path` (ex: `1/517/`): which category to use for the main
  navigation menu.~~ Removed in `2.7.0`.
- `cookieMaxAgeInMonths` the consent cookie's maxage in months. The consent
  cookie stores the user cookies authorizations and when cleared the cookie
  banner will reapear to the user on next visit. As of `2.12.0` and patch
  releases `2.11.1`, `2.10.3`, `2.9.5`, `2.8.6`, `2.7.4`, `2.6.3`, `2.5.5`,
  `2.5.5`, `2.4.9` the default will be 12 month but if you are on Front-Commerce
  version less than the ones above configuring `cookieMaxAgeInMonths` in your
  `src/config/website.js` IS A MUST. Otherwise you run the risk of the cookie
  banner showing to your user everytime he closes and opens his browser. Which
  is very annoying to the user and may lead to the user denying consent and thus
  the loss of valuable analytics insights.
- `default_image_url` (ex: an absolute URL of an image): which image to use when
  no image path has been given to
  [`<ResizedImage>`](/docs/advanced/production-ready/media-middleware#lt-resizedimage-gt-component)
- `defaultTitle`: the default meta title of your application
- `defaultDescription`: the default meta description of your application
- `available_page_sizes`: which page sizes to display in a product list page (or
  any page with a pagination)
- `website_id`: which website is used within magento (needed for customer
  related mutations)
- `tax` (ex: `1.2` for 20% VAT): Used to correctly filter products within layer
  queries (this configuration should soon be deprecated with search updates in
  Front-Commerce â€” see
  [#102](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/102))
- `contentSecurityPolicy`: the <abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr>
  configuration
  [see the related guide](/docs/reference/content-security-policy.mdx)
- `search`: an object that defines how the Elasticsearch queries should be made.
  - `dynamicFacetSize`: number of filters to fetch from Elasticsearch
  - `ignoredAttributeKeys`: attribute codes to ignore when generating facets
    with Elasticsearch
  - `attributeFacetMinimumDocumentCount`: the minimum number of document an
    attribute facet needs to match to be displayed. It is set to 1 by default,
    that means only attribute facets leading to at least one document are
    displayed. By setting it to 0, attribute facets leading to no document are
    also displayed but disabled in the UI.
  - `authorizedCategoriesFacet`: array of ids of the categories that should be
    displayed in the filters. The string `"*"` can be used to allow all
    categories. Default value: `[]`.
  - `categoryFacetMinimumDocumentCount`: the minimum number of document a
    category facet needs to match to be displayed. It is set to 1 by default,
    that means only category facets leading to at least one document are
    displayed. By setting it to 0, category facets leading to no document are
    also displayed but disabled in the UI.
- `theme-color`: a CSS value that will be used in your layout for a
  `<meta name="theme-color" />`
- `phoneNumber`: support/contact number of the website
- `email`: support/contact email of the website
- `maxAddressLength`: max length for one line of address
  ([default is 35](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/254290/GDS%20Catalogue%20Vol%202.pdf))
- `rewrittenToRoot`: array of the URLs that should be redirected to `/`
- `preload`: an object that defines how the preload features work in
  Front-Commerce
  - `maxConcurrentPreload`: the number of parallel requests that can be launched
    for preloading purpose (default: `3`)
  - `maxPreloadQueueLength`: the number of preload requests to store before
    aborting old ones (default: `30`)
  - `intersectionObserverOptions`: `IntersectionObserver` options to know when
    to trigger a preload based on a link's position on screen (default:
    `{ rootMargin: "0px" }`)
  - `timeoutBeforePreload`: the duration in milliseconds to wait before
    triggering a link's preload once it has entered the screen (default: `500`)
  - `intersectionObserverDevices`: the type of devices where intersection
    observers should be used for preload. We usually don't want it on desktop to
    avoid triggering too many requests. (default: `["phone", "tablet"]`)

You could find many other configurations in such a file because some
configurations could come from optional modules. Some of these are:

- `color_attribute_id`: allows to display the colors swatches for the color
  attribute (swatches should be detected automatically in the future)
- `mapsKey`: Google maps key for Colissimo shipping method

### `config/licences.js`

This makes it possible to configure the GSC text.

This file should export an object where the keys are the store's code (see
[Configure multiple stores](/docs/advanced/production-ready/multistore)) and the
value is a string (with some html content if needed).

### `config/httpAuth.js`

Configure a
[Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
on your server (usually for dev environments).

```js
module.exports = {
  // enable basic authentication
  enable: true,
  // allow these IPs to bypass the basic authentication
  whitelist: [
    "x.x.x.x",
  ]

  // Headers where it's most likely to find the client IP
  // Useful for logging the client's ip in the client logger (cf. https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/23)
  headers: ["x-real-ip", "x-forwarded-for"],
};
```

To configure which login/password to use with the Basic Authentication, setup
the file `.htpasswd` at the root of your project.

#### `headers`

The `headers` configuration in `config/httpAuth.js` exists to let the server
know how to retrieve the client's IP (for logging and debugging purpose). This
is because most node servers are behind proxies that pass the client's IP as a
HTTP request header.

Thus, if you are indeed behind a proxy, you must make sure that:

1. The client's IP is passed within a header
2. the `headers` array contains the header's key

By default most proxies are setting either `x-real-ip` or `x-forwarded-for`. So
that's a sane default. But if you have some issues retrieving the client's IP,
please check that those headers are correctly configured within your proxy.

:::note

This setting is used even without enabling basic authentication to pass the
client IP to the third party servers.

### `config/hardcodedSitemap.js`

Allows to define static routes within your application that aren't already
fetched dynamically from your backend. Each object should match the Sitemapable
interface of `src/server/model/store/schema.gql`

```js
module.exports = [
  {
    path: "/",
    priority: 1,
    changefreq: "daily",
    lastmod: new Date("2017-06-01").toISOString(),
  },
];
```

### `config/autocomplete.js`

Allows to define which kind of entities should be returned within the search
bar.

Available values are : "products", "categories" and "pages".

```js
module.exports = ["products", "categories", "pages"];
```

### `config/caching.js`

Allows to define configurations related to dataloader caching and
implementations. It can export a configuration with the following keys:

- `defaultMaxBatchSize`: default batch size used for dataloaders (unless
  specified during instantiation) (default: `100`)
- `strategies`: list of caching strategies to use in the application (default:
  `[]`)

Each strategy can be configured with the keys below:

- `implementation`: name of the
  [implementation of this strategy](/docs/advanced/graphql/dataloaders-and-cache-invalidation#caching-strategies)
  (**mandatory**)
- `supports`: list of loaders impacted by this strategy. Either an array of
  values or `"*"` for all. (**mandatory**)
- `disabledFor`: list of loaders not impacted by this strategy (default: `[]`)
- `config`: an object containing implementation specific configuration (default:
  `{}`)

:::note

Loaders are identified with a key. The key is the first argument passed to the
`makeDataLoader` factory.

:::

Example of a recommended configuration for Magento stores:

```js
export default {
  defaultMaxBatchSize: 100,
  strategies: [
    {
      implementation: "Redis",
      supports: "*",
      config: {
        host: "redis",
        // host: "127.0.0.1"
      },
    },
    {
      implementation: "PerMagentoCustomerGroup",
      supports: ["CatalogPrice"],
      config: {
        defaultGroupId: 0,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

### `config/sessions.js`

Allows to define configurations related to the sessions of the users connected
to your website.

- `store`: factory function to use a custom data store to support sessions
  rather than the default one relying on the filesystem. For instance, if you
  want to connect to redis, you would have to return in the `store` function a
  `new RedisStore(options)` from
  [connect-redis](https://github.com/tj/connect-redis).

See details and examples in the
[Setup sessions](/docs/advanced/production-ready/sessions) page.

### `config/rateLimit.js`

Allows to define configurations related to GraphQL rate limiting feature.

- `store`: factory function to use a custom data store to support rate limiting
  memory

See
[Use a persistent store](/docs/advanced/graphql/rate-limiting#use-a-persistent-store)
for further information.
