### Overview

Front-Commerce provides a Gezy call testing tool, accessible at
[http://localhost:4000/\_\_front-commerce/gezy/playground](http://localhost:4000/__front-commerce/gezy/playground)
in development and staging environments.

This tool allows developers and testers to simulate HTTP requests to the
configured Gezy instance, as done by Front-Commerce internally.

### Key Features

- Recap of the Gezy configuration
- Create a request using a form
- Prompt for confirmation before sending the request
- Share URLs to teammates, with pre-filled request settings that can be
  customized by the recipient
- Show details of the sent request (including signature parameters generated by
  Front-Commerce) and the Gezy response (HTTP code, payload...)

### Using the Tool

1. Access the
   [http://localhost:4000/\_\_front-commerce/gezy/playground](http://localhost:4000/__front-commerce/gezy/playground)
   URL in your development or staging environment.
2. Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
3. Specify the Gezy endpoint you want to call. It is pre-filled with documented
   API endpoints from your Gezy instance.
4. Add query parameters (optional).
5. Write the request body (optional).
6. Click the "Send" button to simulate the call.
7. The tool will display information about the sent request (signature, etc.)
   and the Gezy response (HTTP code, payload...).

The URL in the browser's address bar will be updated with the request settings
every time you submit a request. You can share this URL with your teammates to
reproduce the same request.
