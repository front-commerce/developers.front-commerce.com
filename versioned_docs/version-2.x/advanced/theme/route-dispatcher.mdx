title: Handle dynamic URLs with the Dispatcher
description:
  In some cases, you will need more control over URL formats. For instance, you
  may prefer to have "/my-product" instead of "/product/my-product-slug" for SEO
  reasons. That is what Front-Commerce's Dispatcher is responsible for and what
  we will cover in this documentation.

URLs formats introduced in the
[Add a new page guide](../../essentials/add-a-page-client-side) are statically
defined. Front-Commerce’s Dispatcher allows to handle dynamically defined URLs.

This page explains how it works and how to use it for your own dynamic contents.

## What is the goal of the Dispatcher?

The dispatcher is actually a component within Front-Commerce that will be
displayed in case no other route was found. Its goal will be to ask the server
(by using the `route` root query in your GraphQL Schema) what kind of page is
associated with the current URL and will display the page's component
accordingly.

Below is a flowchart illustrating the URL resolution logic:

<Figure>
  <DispacherFigure
    role="img"
    aria-label="Diagram explaining how a URL is displayed"
    className="text-black dark:text-white" // the lines use currentColor
    width="100%"
  />
</Figure>

If you come from a Magento background, this is the concept behind
[URL Rewrites](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/marketing/url-rewrite.html).

In Front-Commerce’s core integrations (such as Magento2), the association
between a URL and a page is already implemented for entities like Products,
Categories, CMS pages… But depending on your own site, you might need to add new
ones.

To do so, you will need to proceed in three steps:

- Register a new urlMatcher
- Add GraphQL type to the dispatcher query
- Add the mapping between the type returned by `route` and the page component
  that should be displayed

## Register a new urlMatcher

:::info Magento

If the url you are trying to add are managed by Magento, you don't need any of
this. You should instead
[add a url rewrite directly in your backend](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/cloud/configure/import-url-rewrites.html),
since the mechanism already exists in the Magento module of Front-Commerce.

:::

To add a new `urlMatcher` to a module you need to register `FrontCommerce/Core`
as a module dependency and then use `registerUrlMatcher` to add a custom
`urlMatcher`:

```js
import typeDefs from "./schema.gql";
// highlight-next-line
import myCustomUrlMatcher from "./urlMatcher.js";
import MyCustomLoader from "./loader.js";
import { makeUserClientFromRequest } from "server/modules/magento2/core/factories";

const moduleDefinition = {
  namespace: "MyCustomModule",
  // highlight-next-line
  dependencies: ["Front-Commerce/Core"],
  typeDefs,
  contextEnhancer: ({ req, loaders }) => {
    const axiosInstance = makeUserClientFromRequest(req);
    const CustomLoader = MyCustomLoader(axiosInstance);
    // highlight-next-line
    loaders.Page.registerUrlMatcher(myCustomUrlMatcher(CustomLoader));
    return {
      MyCustomLoader: CustomLoader,
    };
  },
};

export default moduleDefinition;
```

```js title="urlMatcher.js"
const myCustomUrlMatcher = (loader) => async (url, match) => {
  if (match.__typename) {
    // a match has already been loaded (you can still override it or return it as is, like we do here)
    return match;
  }
  const myMatch = await loader.loadByUrl(url);
  if (!myMatch) {
    return match; // return original match if none is found, (⚠️ this is required!)
  }
  return {
    // return your custom routable entity
    path: myMatch.canonical_url || url, // depending on your use case, it can be same as the url
    url,
    __typename: "MyCustomType", // the GraphQL type of your custom type (should be added in schema.gql),
    ...myMatch, // or some adaptation of it. this will be available to your component defined bellow on a prop called `matched`
  };
};

export default myCustomUrlMatcher;
```

```graphql title="schema.gql"
MyCustomType implements Routable {
  path: String! # needed for Routable
  title: String! # example field
  ... # define own schema
}
```

```js title="loader.js"
const MyCustomLoader = (axiosInstance) => {
  return {
    loadByUrl: (url) => {
      return (
        // example: get data by issuing an external api call
        axiosInstance
          .get(`/my/api/my-custom-entity?url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`)
          .then((response) => response.data)
          .catch((err) =>
            err.response?.status === 404 ? null : Promise.reject(err)
          )
      );
    },
  };
};
```

:::note

See [Loaders](/docs/advanced/graphql/slim-down-resolvers-with-loaders)
documentation to learn how to instantiate your loader and add it to your GraphQL
context.

:::

Once this is done, you should be able to test that everything works as expected
by using the GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:4000/playground and
executing the following query:

```graphql
{
  route(url: "some-dynamic-custom-url") {
    path
    ... on MyCustomType {
      title # example
    }
  }
}
```

## Add GraphQL type to the dispatcher query

Override `DispatcherQuery` if you have not already done so. You can find it
under `src/web/theme/modules/Router/DispatcherQuery.gql`.

Add an [inline fragment](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments) to
the `DispatcherQuery` for your newly created GraphQL type:

```graphql title="my-module/web/theme/modules/Router/DispatcherQuery.gql"
#import "theme/pages/Product/ProductFragment.gql"
#import "theme/pages/Category/CategoryFragment.gql"
#import "theme/pages/CmsPage/CmsPageFragment.gql"
#import "theme/pages/Product/ProductCacheControlFragment.gql"
#import "theme/pages/Category/CategoryCacheControlFragment.gql"
#import "theme/pages/CmsPage/CmsPageCacheControlFragment.gql"
// highlight-start
#import 'path/to/your/fragment/MyCustomTypeFragment.gql'
#import 'path/to/your/fragment/MyCustomTypeCacheControlFragment.gql'
// highlight-end

query MatchUrls($url: String!, $params: QueryInput) {
  route(url: $url) {
    path
    __typename
    ... on RedirectEntity {
      redirectTo
      redirectType
    }
    ... on Product {
      ...ProductFragment
      ...ProductCacheControlFragment
    }
    ... on Category {
      ...CategoryFragment
      ...CategoryCacheControlFragment
    }
    ... on CmsPage {
      ...CmsPageFragment
      ...CmsPageCacheControlFragment
    }
    // highlight-start
    ... on MyCustomType {
      ...MyCustomTypeFragment
      ...MyCustomTypeCacheControlFragment # optional check note below for link
    }
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```

```graphql title="path/to/your/fragment/MyCustomTypeFragment.gql"
fragment MyCustomTypeFragment on MyCustomType {
  title
  # more fields go here
}
```

## Add the mapping between the `__typename` and the page component

Once your server is correctly configured, you need to map the `__typename` of
your GraphQL datatype to a custom component.

To do so, you need to create the `my-module/web/moduleRoutes.js` file in your
module that will contain the mapping. You might have already created it if you
followed the
[Add a new page](/docs/essentials/add-a-page-client-side#map-the-url-to-the-page-component)
guide. But instead of using the default export, you will need to export a named
object `dispatchedRoutes`.

This object has `__typenames` as keys (in our case `MyCustomType`), and a render
function as values that will tell the application what to render for a specific
key (in our case, it renders `MyCustomPage`). This will give you something like
this:

```js title="my-module/web/moduleRoutes.js"
import React from "react";
import MyCustomPage from "theme/pages/MyCustomPage";

export const dispatchedRoutes = {
  MyCustomType: (props) => <MyCustomPage dataPropName={props.matched} />,
};

// you can still export your static routes here
// export default () => [
//   <Route ... />
// ];
```

In the props passed to a render function (L6), you will have access to a
`matched` property which is the object returned by your `matchUrl` function.

### Advanced queries

If your route contains parameters for the GraphQL query (e.g: `?page=2`), you
should declare a `variables` property in your custom `dispatchedRoutes`
component.

This `variables` function will be called by Front-Commerce when configuring the
GraphQL query. It allows you to provide custom variables for the `MatchUrls`
GraphQL query defined in `DispatcherQuery.gql`.

Here is an example of a custom type providing a `$page: Int` variable to the
`MatchUrls` query:

```js title="my-module/web/moduleRoutes.js"
import React from "react";
import MyCustomPage from "theme/pages/MyCustomPage";

export const dispatchedRoutes = {
  MyCustomPaginatedType: {
    render: (props) => <MyCustomPage dataPropName={props.matched} />,
    variables: (params) => {
      const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(params.location.search);
      return {
        page: searchParams.get("page"),
      };
    },
  },
};
```

## Restart the application

Once you've created your file, you can refresh your application
(`npm run start`), and you should see your new route if you go to the
`/some-dynamic-custom-url` URL. It will display `MyCustomPage` component.

And that is it! 🎉 From now on, any URL that is matched by the url matcher, will
now be displayed with the render function defined in your `dispatchedRoutes`
export under the matching key. Otherwise, a 404 page will still be displayed to
the user.
