## Configuration

Serving assets from a custom domain can be done with a configuration change:

1. for each store in `config/stores`, you can add a `assetsBaseUrl` entry so
   that static assets and images are served from it. For instance:

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     default: {
       url: process.env.FRONT_COMMERCE_URL,
       assetsBaseUrl: "http://a.cdn.example.com",
       locale: "en-US",
       currency: "EUR",
       default_country_id: "GB",
       countries: (IsoCountries) =>
         IsoCountries.registerLocale(
           require("i18n-iso-countries/langs/en.json")
         ),
     },
   };
   ```

   In a multiple store setup, it's possible to use the same `assetsBaseUrl` for
   all stores.

1. [Configure the <abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr>](/docs/reference/content-security-policy.mdx)
   so that assets can be loaded from this external URL

After restarting Front-Commerce, your assets should be loaded from this custom
domain.

:::note

The `assetsBaseUrl` configuration only effects your `production` environment. In
the `development` environment, your assets will still be served from the root of
your application.
