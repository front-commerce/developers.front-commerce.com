title: Scripts

  When in production or during deployment, there are some tasks that are better
  automated. Front-Commerce contains scripts aimed at being used on your server
  when your application is running. This reference documentation explains how to
  use them.

We plan to improve the way scripts are created and used in the future, and allow
developers to register custom scripts from their applications. If interested for
more context, please see
[#169](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/169)
for further details and do note hesitate to send us feedback about this feature.

## `imageWarmUp.js`

The `imageWarmUp.js` script allows to generate images in your application cache,
to prevent manipulating media (fetching, resizing…) on the fly as much as
possible.

It reuses the configurations presented in the
[optimize your media](/docs/advanced/production-ready/media-middleware) page to
generate a combination of images and formats used in your application.

To run it, you can add the following line in your application’s `package.json`
`scripts` section:

```json
"scripts": {
  // […]
  "imageswarmup": "node node_modules/front-commerce/scripts/imageWarmUp.js",
  // […]
}
```

From the root of your application you could then run `npm run imageswarmup` to
populate your images cache with all images available in your shop.

By default, it will ensure all images are available by creating images not
already present in the cache. The script supports additional options:

- `--purge`: remove cached images matching the current preset before generating
  new ones
- `--clear`: remove all cached images before generating new ones
- `--verbose`: displays details about the actions done by the script, to help
  with troubleshooting
- an arbitrary number of image sizes (preset name) to warmup. In this case, the
  script will only generate and optionally purge images in this preset.

Usage example:

```shell
npm run imageswarmup -- --purge thumbnail small
```

## `sitemap.js`

The `sitemap.js` script allows to generate sitemaps with pages available in your
application.

It uses pages exposed in the `Query.sitemap` root query of the application
GraphQL server to generate one sitemap per
[store configured](/docs/essentials/installation#configure-stores) along with a
sitemap index.

To run this script, you can add the following line in your application’s
`package.json` `scripts` section:

```json
"scripts": {
  // […]
  "sitemap": "node node_modules/front-commerce/scripts/sitemap.js",
  // […]
}
```

From the root of your application you could then run `npm run sitemap` to
generate/update sitemaps.

If your base url is https://example.com/, the generated sitemap index would be
available at https://example.com/sitemaps/sitemap.xml. We recommend to reference
it in your `robots.txt` file, by creating for instance the following file in
your public directory (e.g: `my-module/public/robots.txt`):

```yaml title="my-module/public/robots.txt"
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemaps/sitemap.xml
```

Usage example:

```shell
npm run sitemap
```
