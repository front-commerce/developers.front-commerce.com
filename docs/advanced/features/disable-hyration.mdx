# What is Hydration?

> _Since version 2.16_

:::info

Hydration or rehydration is a technique in which client-side JavaScript converts
a static HTML web page, delivered either through static hosting or server-side
rendering, into a dynamic web page by attaching event handlers to the HTML
elements. Because the HTML is pre-rendered on a server, this allows for a fast
"first contentful paint" (when useful data is first displayed to the user), but
there is a period of time afterward where the page appears to be fully loaded
and interactive, but is not until the client-side JavaScript is executed and
event handlers have been attached.

## Disabling Hydration

While it is not recommended to disable hydration in some senarios one might want
to do that. For example to disable the render cycle of the Google crawler bot.

To disable hydration in Front-Commerce you need to set a variable called
`__HYDRATE__` to true on the global `window` object. To do so you can add the
following snippet to your template HTML file (`src/template/index.html`):

```html title="my-module/template/index.html"
<script>
  window.__HYDRATE__ = location.host !== "webcache.googleusercontent.com";
</script>
```

:::warning

Please ensure your condition is well architected as disabling hydration for a
user will render the site in an unusable state.
