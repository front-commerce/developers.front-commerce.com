## Add a custom attribute to Customers

A custom attribute named `reset_password_token` must be added to BigCommerce
Customer. For that, you can use
[the Customer Attribute API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/0b427d58415e1-create-a-customer-attribute)
to create it:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/yhowbpps2e/v3/customers/attributes \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-Auth-Token: authtoken' \
  --data '[
  {
    "name": "reset_password_token",
    "type": "string"
  }
]'
```

To generate an auth token please refer to
[BigCommerce Access Tokens documentation](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/e861a9c6b77b5-authentication#access-tokens).

## Configure the email

When a customer reaches the password reset page and fills the form with a valid
and recognized email, Front-Commerce will send an email to this customer so that
they can change their password.

:::note

This link is valid for 20 minutes.

### Configure the SMTP server and email sender

The SMTP server used to send this email must be configured through the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_BIG_COMMERCE_RESET_PASSWORD_SMTP_CONNECTION_STRING` environment
variable while the sender of this email is configured in
`FRONT_COMMERCE_BIG_COMMERCE_RESET_PASSWORD_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS`:

```shell
# can also be a `smtp://` URL. Login, password and port are optional
FRONT_COMMERCE_BIG_COMMERCE_RESET_PASSWORD_SMTP_CONNECTION_STRING=smtps://login:password@example.com:465
# can also be a plain email address
FRONT_COMMERCE_BIG_COMMERCE_RESET_PASSWORD_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS=My store <noreply@example.com>
```

### Email template

The BigCommerce Password Reset template is used to generate the email subject
and body. It can be customized from the control panel under _Marketing >
Transactional emails_ as explained in
[the Customizing Emails guide](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Customizing-Emails?language=en_US).

:::note

We do our best to replicate the environment in which the template is interpreted
so that the preview and the actual email content work as expected, however there
are a few differences between the BigCommerce environment and the Front-Commerce
one:

- in global variables, `store.domain_name`, `store.path` and `store.img_path`
  are based on the Front-Commerce URL
- we only support
  [the `lang` handlebars template helper](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/ZG9jOjIyMDcxOA-handlebars-helpers-reference)
  currently. Calling any other helper will result in an empty string and a
  warning will be logged. Please <ContactLink /> if you have use cases requiring
  more than that.
