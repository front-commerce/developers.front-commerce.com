## Front-Commerce tips

<!-- TODO drastically improve the core web vitals documentaion -->

### Mark above-the-fold images as priority

Using: `<Image src="xxxx" priority />`

### Improve your fonts performance

- [Self-host your custom (Google) fonts](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chromes-new-cache-partitioning-system-impacts-google-fonts-performance/)
- Use WOFF2 format
- Use `font-display: optional`
- Preload key fonts by naming them with the suffix: `*.priority.woff2`

### One query per route

You must aim at One GraphQL query per Front-Commerce route. Keep additional
queries for secondary content.

Ensure that this query is preloadable (using the top level `graphqlWithPreload`
HOC).
