## Magento 1 requirements

On Magento's side, you need to install
[the `algolia/algoliasearch-magento` module](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-magento).
You can install it with modman:

```shell
modman clone https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-magento.git
```

After the installation, you need to configure it, at least:

1. in System > Algolia Search > Configuration in the _Credentials & Setup_
   section, set the _Enable Indexing_ option
1. in the same section, fill the credentials you can find on
   [the Algolia Dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard/api-keys)
1. The attribute `category_ids` must be listed in both the facets configuration
   and in the indexed product attributes (and there it must be set as
   _Searchable_) as Front-Commerce relies on it to list the products in
   categories.

You can then run the indexer so that the products are indexed in Algolia's
index.

:::note

`category_ids` is the only required facets. Depending on your project, you can
configure any other attribute to be exposed as a facet by following the same
steps.

:::

## Front-Commerce

[After installing the Algolia package](/docs/3.x/extensions/algolia/#installation),
you need to enable the corresponding extension. For that, you need to tweak your
`front-commerce.config.ts` file like:

```typescript title="front-commerce.config.ts for a Magento¬1 based project"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/config";
import themeChocolatine from "@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine";
import magento1 from "@front-commerce/magento1";
// highlight-next-line
import algolia from "@front-commerce/algolia";
import storesConfig from "./app/config/stores";
import cacheConfig from "./app/config/caching";

export default defineConfig({
  extensions: [
    // highlight-next-line
    algolia("magento1"), // ⚠️ need to be before magento1()
    magento1({ storesConfig }),
    themeChocolatine(),
  ],
  stores: storesConfig,
  cache: cacheConfig,
  configuration: {
    providers: [],
  },
});
```

:::caution Known issue

The Algolia extension definition needs to appear before the one for Magento in
the `extensions` array.

:::

Front-Commerce retrieves the following parameters from Magento:

- [the Application ID](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/how-to/importing-with-the-api/#application-id)
- [the search only API key](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/#search-only-api-key)
- the index name prefix
- the number of values per facet
- the configured facet attributes

On the configured facets, only the attribute name and the facet type are taken
into account (_Label_, _Searchable_ and _Create Query rule_ are ignored for
now).

:::caution

For performance reason, the configuration retrieved from Magento is cached. As a
result, after changing a parameter in the backoffice, the new parameter will be
taken into account after at most one minute by Front-Commerce.

:::

## Test it

To make sure Algolia APIs and indices are properly used, you can restart
Front-Commerce with the `DEBUG` environment variable containing
`front-commerce:algolia` so that it displays various information on the
requests:

```bash title="Run Front-Commerce with Algolia's debug flag"
DEBUG=front-commerce:algolia pnpm run dev
```

After restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able to run a GraphQL query to
search for products, categories or pages, for instance:

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000/graphql"
query Search {
  search(query: "whatever you want to search for") {
    query
    products(params: { from: 0, size: 5 }) {
      total
      products {
        sku
        name
      }
    }
    categories(size: 5) {
      name
    }
    pages(size: 5) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```
