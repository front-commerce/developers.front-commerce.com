In this section, you will learn some advanced usages of the Magento 2
integration.

## Additional headers in Magento API calls

> _Since version 2.7.0_

Front-Commerce allows you to send additional headers in all API calls. To do so,
you must define the `magento.api.extraHeaders` (for storefront API) and/or
`magento.api.extraAdminHeaders` (for admin API) configuration values from a
[configuration provider](/docs/advanced/server/configurations#What-is-a-configuration-provider).

These additional headers could be useful if you want to add additional context
to your queries, depending on the request or to detect Front-Commerce requests
from your Magento server.

## Clearing Front-Commerce cache

There are two ways to clear the magento cache:

1. Run the below command from the command line on the magento server:

   ```shell
   bin/magento cache:clean -- front-commerce
   ```

2. From the admin interface go to System > Cache Management then select
   Front-Commerce, make sure that refresh is selected and then click the Submit
   button. (see below screenshot for more details).
