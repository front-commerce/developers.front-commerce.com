description:
  Front-Commerce contains mechanisms that allow to process of payments in a
  platform-agnostic way. Payment platforms integrated as a Front-Commerce
  Payment are compatible with every eCommerce platform that Front-Commerce
  supports. This guide provides insights about how they work so you can better
  understand how they could fit into your project.

With Front-Commerce payments, interactions occur from Front-Commerce
GraphQL/Node.js middleware so that remote systems
(<abbr title="Order Management System">OMS</abbr>,

<abbr title="Enterprise resource planning">ERP</abbr> softwares …) will only receive
Orders when they are paid.

These payment methods are also aimed at being as frictionless as possible for
Customers, so payment inputs are usually embedded in the checkout page to
prevent redirecting Customers to third-party providers. Per their nature follow
the
[Direct Order payment workflow](/docs/advanced/payments/payment-workflows#direct-order).

## How is a Front-Commerce Payment method integrated with eCommerce platforms

Front-Commerce handle payments directly, without the need for a payment
integration in your eCommerce system. However, **Front-Commerce provides a
generic Payment method** tailored for your eCommerce platform so that you can
still benefit from its order management features and workflows.

From your eCommerce system's perspective, a payment made with Front-Commerce is
integrated in a similar way than checks / wire payments (sometimes named
"offline payment"). The difference is that Front-Commerce will update orders
statuses upon receiving automatic notifications from the payment service.

## Implement a new Front-Commerce Payment method

:::caution WIP

This section is not as detailed as we would love it to be. Please let us know if
you need further information before we improve it.

:::

Front-Commerce allows you to implement your own payment method. New embedded
payment methods have to be registered from a GraphQL module. Let’s create a new
"PWAy" payment module for a fictive payment provider.

1. [create a new GraphQL module](/docs/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema#create-a-new-graphql-module)
2. add a depency upon `"Magento2/Checkout"`

   ```js
   export default {
     namespace: "Payments/PWAy",
     dependencies: ["Magento2/Checkout"],
   };
   ```

3. register the payment method from the module’s
   [`contextEnhancer`](/docs/reference/graphql-module-definition#contextenhancer-optional)

   ```js
   export default {
     namespace: "Payments/PWAy",
     dependencies: ["Magento2/Checkout"],
     contextEnhancer: ({ loaders }) => {
       // [...] initialization here

       const chargeTransactionForOrder = (paymentData, orderId) => {
         /* … the actual code that will charge the transaction (might delegate to a loader) … */
       };

       const METHOD_CODE = "pway_awesomecheckout";
       const METHOD_TITLE = "PWAy";
       loaders.Payment.registerEmbeddedPaymentMethod(
         METHOD_CODE,
         METHOD_TITLE,
         chargeTransactionForOrder
       );

       return {}; // you may export loaders here in case the payment provides custom Queries (to fetch a payment token for instance)
     },
   };
   ```

:::note

We encourage you to investigate `payment-` modules' source code from
[Front-Commerce's core](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/main/src/server/modules)
to learn about advanced patterns.
