title: Custom Payment Information
description:
  Implemented payment methods don't need any additional information. The user
  only needs to select one of the implemented payment methods and then will be
  prompted to enter all the required information. However, you may require more
  information, for example, if you want to let users enter a comment related to
  the payment method/checkout. This guide explains how to achieve it in
  Front-Commerce.

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

All the code that will be created in this page should live in your own module.
You can either put it in your client code or create a specific module for the
payment method(s). If you create a specific one, please keep in mind that you
need to register it in `.front-commerce.js`.

## Display a custom input for a payment method

You should register a new component in `getAdditionalDataComponent.js` by
following this template:

```js title="my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js"
import CustomComponent from "theme/modules/CustomComponent/CustomComponent";

const ComponentMap = {
  "<method_code>": CustomComponent,
};

// ... the rest of the code should be kept intact
```

The Custom component referenced here should be created in your own module, and
display the additional information of your payment method to the user.

```js title="my-module/web/theme/modules/CustomComponent/CustomComponent.js"
import React from "react";
import SubmitPayment from "theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/SubmitPayment";

const CustomComponent = ({
  onAuthorize,
  value,
  gscAccepted,
  error,
  method,
}) => {
  const [comments, setComments] = useState(value?.comments ?? "");

  return (
    <div className="custom-component">
      <input
        onChange={(event) => setComments(event.target.value)}
        value={comments}
        type="text"
      />
      <SubmitPayment
        gscAccepted={gscAccepted}
        onSubmit={() => {
          onAuthorize(gscAccepted ? { comments } : null);
        }}
        error={this.props.error}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default CustomComponent;
```

Things to understand here:

- The `SubmitPayment` component is a common component across all payment methods
  to ensure consistency in how methods are managed.
- `method` the current selected method.
- `value` contains initial additional data (usually it is always null).
- `onAuthorize` should be called with the additional data on `<SubmitPayment>`'s
  on submit method.
- `gscAccepted` whether or not the user have accepted the general sales
  conditions (checkbox above the "Place my order" button). Just forward this to
  the `<SubmitPayment>` component.
- `error` an error object if there is an error. Just forward this to the
  `<SubmitPayment>` component.

In this example we're only setting a comments additional text input, but you can
do fancier things like fetching a list for the user to pick from GraphQL and
displaying them here.

## Updating an existing method Additional Data

Sometimes you may need to add an extra field to the additional data of an
existing payment method. You first need to check if this payment method already
has an `AdditionalDataComponent` registered.

- [x] If `AdditionalDataComponent` has been registered, you should then override
      the `AdditionalDataComponent` and add your custom modifications.
- [ ] If no `AdditionalDataComponent` is registered, you can then follow the
      [Display a custom input for a payment method](#Display-a-custom-input-for-a-payment-method)
      docs.

## Adding a field to all payment methods

You should enhance the `AdditionalDataComponent` by following this template:

```js title="my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js"
import CustomEnhancer from 'theme/modules/CustomModule/CustomEnhancer'

const ComponentMap = {
  ..., // registered additional data
};

const getAdditionalDataComponent = (method) => {
  const Component = ComponentMap[method.code];
  return CustomEnhancer(Component);
};

export default getAdditionalDataComponent;
```

The CustomEnhancer referenced here should be created in your own module. It
should display the base component sent to it and add additional data fields and
override the `onAuthorize` method.

```js title="my-module/web/theme/modules/CustomModule/CustomEnhancer.js"
import React from "react";
import SubmitPayment from "theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/SubmitPayment";

const CustomEnhancer =
  (BaseComponent) =>
  ({ onAuthorize, value, gscAccepted, error, method }) => {
    const [comments, setComments] = useState(value?.comments ?? "");

    return (
      <div className="custom-enhancer">
        <input
          onChange={(event) => setComments(event.target.value)}
          value={comments}
          type="text"
        />
        {BaseComponent ? (
          <BaseComponent
            onAuthorize={(additionalData) => {
              onAuthorize({ ...additionalData, comments });
            }}
            value={value}
            gscAccepted={gscAccepted}
            error={error}
            method={method}
          />
        ) : (
          <SubmitPayment
            gscAccepted={gscAccepted}
            onSubmit={() => {
              onAuthorize(gscAccepted ? { comments } : null);
            }}
            error={this.props.error}
          />
        )}
      </div>
    );
  };

export default CustomEnhancer;
```
