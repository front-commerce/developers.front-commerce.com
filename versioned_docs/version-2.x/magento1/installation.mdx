import SinceVersion from "@site/src/components/SinceVersion";

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

## Module compatibility

We recommend to use [OpenMageÂ LTS](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts)
(1.9.4.x - v19.x) with at least PHP 7.3 (with OpenSSL) and MySQL 8.0. It is also
compatible with Magento CE >= 1.7 and Magento EE 1.12.x.

## Installation

You can use 2 ways for installation, we recommend to use composer.

### Install with composer

#### Prerequisites

- Have a working install of [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
- You need to create a (or retrieve an existing) token from your Gitlab account
  and replace `$FC_GITLAB_TOKEN` by your token on the next step.

#### Composer usage

For a community edition version:

```shell
composer config minimum-stability dev
composer config repositories.front-commerce git https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento1-module-front-commerce.git
composer config repositories.front-commerce-restful git https://github.com/PH2M/Magento-Extra-RESTful
composer config http-basic.gitlab.blackswift.cloud token $FC_GITLAB_TOKEN
composer require front-commerce/magento1-module:"^1.3"
```

For an enterprise edition version:

```shell
composer config minimum-stability dev
composer config repositories.front-commerce-ee git https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento1-module-enterprise-front-commerce
composer config repositories.front-commerce git https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento1-module-front-commerce.git
composer config repositories.front-commerce-restful git https://github.com/PH2M/Magento-Extra-RESTful
composer config http-basic.gitlab.blackswift.cloud token $FC_GITLAB_TOKEN
composer require front-commerce/magento1-module-enterprise:"dev-master"
```

:::note

`front-commerce/magento1-module-enterprise` is currently in beta, requiring
`dev-master` allows to get the last version. After this beta phase, it is
strongly recommended to use a fixed version.
([see available release for Enterprise Edition](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento1-module-enterprise-front-commerce/-/releases))

:::

### Install directly in your Magento app folder

- Community edition version:

  1. Clone or download
     https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento1-module-front-commerce.git

     Magento's `app/etc/modules` directory
  5. Create `app/code/community/Clockworkgeek/Extrarestful` directory in your
     Magento's
  6. Copy all directories inside `code` in your Magento's
     `app/code/community/Clockworkgeek/Extrarestful` directory

- Enterprise edition version:

  1. Clone or download
     https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento1-module-front-commerce.git
  2. Copy `app` directory and paste it in your Magento's root directory
  3. Clone or download
     https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento1-module-enterprise-front-commerce

     Magento's
  8. Copy all directories inside `code` in your Magento's
     `app/code/community/Clockworkgeek/Extrarestful` directory

## Configuration

:::note

If the installation is successful, in Magento's administration panel, you will
have a new entry "Front-Commerce" in the top menu and a new tab "Front-Commerce"
in System > Configuration.

:::

### Check install

Go to the `Front-Commerce > Configuration` admin menu entry. You should see an
"Installer checker" that will ensure that everything is configured correctly in
your shop.

Right after your first installation, most of the checks should be invalid.
Please refer to the next steps to validate them.

### REST roles

Front-Commerce requires you to define 3 roles.

Here are the main steps:

- Go to admin menu entry `System > Web services > REST Roles`
- You need to have 3 roles, `Guest`, `Customer`, and `Admin`. If you don't,
  create them.
- Set all roles access to all resources (Role API Resources tab > Resource
  Access "All").

See the
[official documentation](https://docs.magento.com/m1/ce/user_guide/system-operations/web-services-activate.html)
for detailed information about how to achieve this with Magento.

### REST attributes

Front-Commerce roles must have access to several data on each entities, so it
can expose them in GraphQL. You must allow each role to read these information.

- Go to admin menu entry `System > Web services > REST Attributes`
- You can see 3 user types `Guest`, `Customer`, and `Admin`.
- Set all ACL attributes rules to all resource access (ACL Attribute Rules tab >
  Resource Access "All").

### REST OAuth Consumer

Front-Commerce must be able to create tokens for users when they log-in. You
should ensure there is a `Front-Commerce` consumer configured in your install.

- Go to admin menu entry `System > Web services > REST OAuth Consumers`
- Add New OAuth Consumer:
  - Name: `Front-Commerce`
  - Callback URL: `http://local.host` <- is useless but can't be empty

The Key/Secret values should be used to configure your Front-Commerce, with the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_CONSUMER_KEY` and
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_CONSUMER_SECRET` environment variables in your `.env`
file.

### Admin user

Advanced features such as Embedded Payments have to use an admin user with REST
access. You must ensure it exists, by doing the following steps.

- Go to admin menu entry `System > Permissions > User`
- Create a new user (only used for Front-Commerce's embedded payments feature,
  users will never interact with your shop using this account)
  - User Name: `Front-Commerce`
  - First Name: `Front-Commerce`
  - Last Name `Front-Commerce`
  - Email: enter an administrator email
  - Password: enter a password
  - REST Role: Admin

### REST admin token

You must generate admin tokens to configure Front-Commerce.

- Go to admin menu entry Front-Commerce > Configuration
- Click on "Generate Token" link in installer checker section (This should be
  the same key as `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ACCESS_TOKEN` and
  `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` in your Front-Commerce `.env`)

### Magento core patch

If the OAuth Zend Patch is not valid in the installer checker, please follow
these steps:

- Copy the
  [`fix-sort-params-core.patch`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento1-module-front-commerce/blob/master/fix-sort-params-core.patch)
  file in your root directory
- Past it on your root Magento directory
- Apply them
  - With GIT: `git apply fix-sort-params-core.patch`
  - Without GIT: `patch -p1 < fix-sort-params-core.patch`

### URLs settings

- Go to System > Configuration > Front-Commerce General > URLs Settings
- Add your Front-Commerce Front URL. In development environment, it should be
  `http://localhost:4000/`. In production environment, it is the URL of your
  main store.
- Go to System > Configuration > General > Web
- Make sure _Add Store Code to Urls_ is disabled
- Set your base URL (secure + unsecure) with your Front-Commerce front URL
  (`http://localhost:4000/` in development environment) for each store view
  value. You can keep your admin URL for the default value.

### Cache settings

- Go to System > Configuration > Front-Commerce General > Cache Settings
- Add random Key (This should be the same key as
  `FRONT_COMMERCE_CACHE_API_TOKEN` in your Front-Commerce `.env`)

### Front-Commerce secret key

For more security add a random key on `frontcommerce_secret_key` in your
`app/etc/local.xml`

```xml
<config>
  <global>
    // highlight-next-line
    <frontcommerce_secret_key>{REPLACE_ME_BY_STRING_VALUE}</frontcommerce_secret_key>
    // ...
```

### Reviews configuration

<SinceVersion tag="2.27" />

Front-Commerce, by default, uses only one review "rating", named `"main"`. Those
are configured in Magento1's back office under
`Catalog > Reviews and Ratings > Manage Ratings`. If your project uses more than
one rating, or one with a different name, you will have to configure them.

In order to do so, you need to override `magento1ReviewsConfigProvider`'s
`ratingTypes` default value. To learn more on how to do this, follow
[the override an existing configuration guide](/docs/2.x/advanced/server/configurations#override-an-existing-configuration).
In this config provider, you will need to add each the name and id of each
provider you want your customer to see.

### Configure facet order

<SinceVersion tag="2.27" />

If you want to be able to organize your facets' order, you will need to enable
it in the `magentoProvider` (see
[code](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/commit/fcaf0d0ddec410caf1a4d250d197e5f382e9004b#d43f790dbbf8f5142f59364a4b017caa013c10b5_82_83)).
In this provider, override `magento.attributes.useFacetSortOrder` to set it to
`true`.

:::tip

To learn more about how to override configuration provider, see our
[guide on overriding an existing provider](/docs/2.x/advanced/server/configurations#override-an-existing-configuration).

:::

Once that's done, all facets will be sorted by their "position" attribute that
is defined in the Magento's back office.

### Clean Magento cache

## Ensure it works

Once this is done, all the checks should be green in your installer checker and
you should be good to go. You can check that the guest permissions are correctly
configured by accessing this URL:

`{MAGENTO_BASE_URL}/api/rest/frontcommerce/urls/match?urls[0]=/about-magento-demo-store`

## Common issues

### URL Rewrite

The entry point of the API is the file `api.php`. In order to work, you need to
have the following rules:

For Apache in an `.htaccess` or in the server configuration:

```
RewriteRule ^api/rest api.php?type=rest [QSA,L]
```

For nginx in server configuration:

```
location /api {
    rewrite ^/api/rest /api.php?type=rest last;
    rewrite ^/api/v2_soap /api.php?type=v2_soap last;
    rewrite ^/api/soap /api.php?type=soap last;
}
```

### Mistake in ACL access

Double check that you have followed [REST roles](#rest-roles) and
[REST attributes](#rest-attributes) sections carefully.
