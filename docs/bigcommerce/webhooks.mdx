## Setting up Front-Commerce

You need to setup the webhook secret within your Front-Commerce app with the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_BIG_COMMERCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable.

:::tip ProTipâ„¢

Create a random secret by running `openssl rand -hex 25` in your terminal.

## Setting up BigCommerce

We will now create webhooks for the following scopes:

- `catalog/*`
- `products/*`
- `sku/*`

We first need to setup Authentication for your BigCommerce account (you can
refer to the
[documentation](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/ZG9jOjIyMDYxMw-v2-and-v3-rest-api-authentication)).

We will need to create the webhook api to get an Access Token and the Store Hash

1. Navigate to your BigCommerce account and click on the `Settings` tab, scroll
   down and open `API > API accounts`.
1. Click on the `+ Create API Account` button.
1. Copy the `API path` as it contains the `Store Hash`.

   <BrowserWindow
     url="https://store-yhowbpps2e.mybigcommerce.com/manage/settings/api-accounts"
     fullscreen
   >
     <Image
       img={require("./assets/new-webhook-storehash.png")}
       alt="Store Hash in BigCommerce API path"
       style="border-radius:5px;"
     />
   </BrowserWindow>

1. Create a new webhook with `read-only` access on the following scopes
   - `Content`
   - `Products`
   - `Customers`
   - `Information & settings`
   - `Marketing`
   - `Orders`
   - `Get payment methods`
   - `Carts`
   - `Checkouts`
   - `Sites & routes`
1. Save the API account, and copy the `Access Token`. (see figure below)

   <BrowserWindow
     url="https://store-yhowbpps2e.mybigcommerce.com/manage/settings/api-accounts"
     fullscreen
   >
     <Image
       img={require("./assets/new-webhook-accesstoken.png")}
       alt="BigCommerce API account access token"
       style="border-radius:5px;"
     />
   </BrowserWindow>

You are now ready to get started with your webhooks, we have created a
[BigCommerce Webhook API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16678499/UzQys4QZ)
in postman to simplify this process, you can hit the `Run in Postman` button and
simply replace all the relevant variables to get started
[creating your webhooks](#Creating-a-webhook).

### Creating a webhook

You can refer to the Create folder in the
[BigCommerce Webhook API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16678499/UzQys4QZ),
to create the correct webhooks.

:::info Important

All listed webhooks are required for cache invalidation.

:::

### Updating a webhook

To update a webhook, you first need to run the `GET ALL WEBHOOKS` api to get an
array of webhooks. You can then replace the `WEBHOOK_ID` variable with the id of
the webhook that you want to remove. Once that has been done you can
`Create a new webhook` with the new settings.
