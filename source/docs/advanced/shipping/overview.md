We support different kind of payments depending on the platform you are working on (Magento2â€¦). The goal of this documentation is to give you a detailed list of supported shipping methods as well as explaining how you can support new shipping methods.

- [Colissimo](/docs/advanced/shipping/colissimo.html)
- [Mondial Relay](/docs/advanced/shipping/mondial-relay.html)

Moreover, the following guides should help you implement custom integrations by using what's available in Front-Commerce:

- [Custom Shipping Information](/docs/advanced/shipping/custom-shipping-information.html)
- [Add a shipping method with pickup points](/docs/advanced/shipping/add-new-shipping-data-in-graphql.html)

If you are looking for detailed information about an existing shipping method or if you're curious about a new integration, please <span class="intercom-launcher">[contact us](mailto:hello@front-commerce.com)</span>. **We are always looking to support more shipping methods.**
