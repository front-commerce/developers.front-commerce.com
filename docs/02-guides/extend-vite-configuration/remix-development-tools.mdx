Since Front-Commerce is based on Remix, you can use any related Remix extension
to enhance your development experience and your project.

In this guide, we will guide you through the setup of
[Remix Development Tools](https://remix-development-tools.fly.dev/).

:::tip

Remix Development Tools isn't affiliated with Front-Commerce. Since we use it to
work on Front-Commerce, we decided to share it with you to enhance your
experience too!

:::

## Quick start

### Install the extension

```sh
pnpm add --save-dev remix-development-tools
```

### Add the extension to your `vite.config.ts`

**Please note that `remixDevTools` plugin must be declared before the
`frontCommerce` plugin**

```diff
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { vitePlugin as frontCommerce } from "@front-commerce/remix/vite";
+import { remixDevTools } from "remix-development-tools";

export default defineConfig((env) => {
  return {
    plugins: [
+     remixDevTools({
+        client: {
+          defaultOpen: false,
+        },
+      }),
      frontCommerce({ env })
    ],
  };
});
```
