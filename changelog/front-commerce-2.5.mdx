## RMA feature, search datasources and shipping modules

Front-Commerce 2.5 is one of the most productive releases we had so far. Our
team worked hard to improve the product and increase its flexibility:

- search datasources allows you to choose between Algolia or ElasticSearch to
  power your search
- new Shipping modules and Map implementations will reduce your integration
  costs
- allow your Customers to return products with
  <abbr title="Return Merchandise Authorization">RMA</abbr>
- leverage our low-level tools to improve your Core Web Vitals

## New Feature: Return Merchandise Authorization

In this release, we've continued to increase our feature coverage by
implementing <abbr title="Return Merchandise Authorization">RMA</abbr>.
**Customers can now select products they purchased from their Order page and ask
for a return**. They can view all their returns from their account dashboard.

<div className="center">![The Return form on mobile](./assets/rma.png)</div>

While the UI is platform agnostic, we implemented the supporting server
implementation in the **Magento1 Enterprise** module. It is fully integrated in
the workflow you are used to and administrators can manage RMAs from the admin
panel as usual.

## Search datasources: Algolia, ElasticSearch

We've reworked our search feature to allow registering different **datasources
modules** without impacting your code. Our existing ElasticSearch implementation
has been extracted in a datasource module, and we implemented a new Algolia
datasource module as part of this release.

**The Algolia module allows Customers to find the product they are looking for
(search, facetsâ€¦) without friction** thanks to Algolia advanced merchandising
features. The datasource only supports products search for now. Category and CMS
pages search will come later.

This new search datasource abstraction will allow us to support other search
engines very easily in the future. Solutions such as **Meilisearch, Klevu or
Typesense** are rising, and each one of them could bring a better, faster search
experience for your Users.

## Shipping modules: Colissimo, Mondial Relay

Front-Commerce 2.5 now supports **Shipping modules, to enhance the checkout
process**. With these new extension points, it is possible to allow Customers to
select the closest Pickup point or select an appointment with supported carriers
for instance.

The first two carriers supported are **Colissimo** (compatible with
[Magento2's Magentix module](https://colissimo.magentix.fr/magento-2/)) and
**Mondial Relay** (compatible with Magento1). Pickup points are displayed in the
checkout with any Map implementation supported (see next section) and saved in
the eCommerce platform as usual.

## Maps: OpenStreetMap, Google Maps

Be it for **a Store Locator or Pickup points selectors**, our Customers often
asked us if we provided performant components to display maps on their
storefront. We seized the opportunity of working on Shipping modules to build
"Map agnostic" components in Front-Commerce core. It means that **if your
application or module relies on Front-Commerce Map components, it will be
compatible with any compatible Map implementations.**

This first release contains Map implementations for the two most commons Map
providers: **OpenStreetMap** (using the
[Leaflet library](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)) and
**[Google Maps ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-maps)**. It means
for instance that you can choose whether your Customers select a Colissimo
Pickup point from an <abbr title="OpenStreetMap">OSM</abbr> or a Google map!

In the future, we could support more implementations such as Mapbox or Maptiler
to allow you to build a perfect integrated experience for your Customers.

## ðŸš€ Performance: batteries included to improve your Core Web Vitals!

Core Web Vitals (introduced in 2020) are signals **measuring how users perceive
the experience of interacting with a web page**. They will become a factor in
Google's ranking algorithm along with the existing UX-related signals.

More and more people are starting to care about these metrics, which is **a
great opportunity to double-down on optimizing your storefront** to meet the
expectations.

Our value proposition has always been to help you deliver smooth buying
experiences using the best practices and frontend technologies. That's why
**Front-Commerce 2.5 contains new tools and sensible defaults to build an
optimized and performant theme**:

- preload critical fonts automatically,
- display above the fold images right away,
- use accessible components,
- send correct HTTP headers for your assetsâ€¦

**From 2.5 onwards, Front-Commerce stores can aim for providing a best-in-class
user experience and obtain great Core Web Vitals scores**.

There is no magic here though. Even if we keep improving the foundation your
store is built upon, **it requires some efforts from your team too**.
Understanding a Lighthouse report or a using the performance Devtools panel is
important, so that you can spot issues in your theme. Then (and only then), you
could use what Front-Commerce offers to implement the optimization.

We have created **a new
[Improve your Core Web Vitals](/docs/2.x/advanced/performance/improve-your-core-web-vitals)
page** in our documentation dedicated to help you understand what is killing
your <abbr title="Cumulative Layout Shift">CLS</abbr>, increasing your

<abbr title="Largest Contentful Paint">LCP</abbr> or slowing your
<abbr title="First Input Delay">FID</abbr>â€¦ and how to fight back. Keep it in
your bookmarks as we will enrich it over time!
