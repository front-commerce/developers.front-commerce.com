## What is the components map?

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

For instance, component map can be useful for:

- implementing a user menu with links contributed from different extensions
- displaying platform-specific components in the application features specific
  to the platform
- customizing how polymorphic GraphQL data are displayed in an application

## How to register a component map?

### Registering a new component map

To register a new component map, you can use the
[`registerFeature`](/docs/3.x/api-reference/front-commerce-core/extension-features#registerfeature)
hook.

```ts title="./example-extension/acme-extension/index.ts"
export default defineExtension({
  ...
  unstable_lifecycleHooks: {
    onFeaturesInit: (hooks) => {
      // highlight-next-line
      hooks.registerFeature("acme-feature", {
        ui: {
          componentsMap: {
            // This should resolve to a valid file relative to the current import.meta.url
            // highlight-next-line
            Header: new URL("./components/AcmeHeader.tsx", import.meta.url),
            Toolbar: new URL("./components/AcmeToolbar.tsx", import.meta.url),
            Footer: new URL("./components/AcmeFooter.tsx", import.meta.url),
          },
        },
      });
    },
  },
});
```

### Override an existing component map

Let's say our application needs to disable the previously registered `Toolbar`
component which is by default registered in the `acme-extension`.

We can achieve this by registering a new component map with the same name, but
replacing the `Toolbar` with `null`

```ts title="./example-extension/application-extension/index.ts"
export default defineExtension({
  ...
  unstable_lifecycleHooks: {
    onFeaturesInit: (hooks) => {
      // this will extend the `acme-feature` from `acme-extension`
      hooks.registerFeature("acme-feature", {
        ui: {
          // we only override the `Toolbar` component, the others will still resolve from `acme-extension`
          // highlight-next-line
          componentsMap: { Toolbar: null },
        },
      });
    },
  },
});
```

:::tip

When overriding an existing component map, the last registered extension will be
the components used for the feature. All the components are merged together. Not
including a component, will maintain the component registered before. To
_unregister_ it, you must explicitly override it with `null`.

So in the above example, the final components map will be resolved as:

```ts
{
  Header: AcmeHeader,
  Toolbar: () => null,
  Footer: AcmeFooter,
}
```

## How to use the components map?

The components map is used through the
[`useExtensionComponentMap`](/docs/3.x/api-reference/front-commerce-core/react#useextensioncomponentmap)
hook.

```tsx
import { useExtensionComponentMap } from "@front-commerce/core/react";

const App = () => {
  const AcmeFeature = useExtensionComponentMap("acme-feature");

  return (
    <div>
      <AcmeFeature.Header />
      <AcmeFeature.Footer />
    </div>
  );
};
```
