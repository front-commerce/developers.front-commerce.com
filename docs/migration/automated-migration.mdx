## Guide

After following the
[Migration Overview](/docs/3.x/migration/migration-overview), you can run the
migrate command for the following codemods:

- `js-to-jsx`: Converts react files from js to jsx
- `3.0.0`: Migrate your project from v2.x to v3.0.0
- `3.0.0-scss.1`: Migrate your projects scss from v2.x to v3.0.0
- `3.0.0-scss.2`: Migrate your projects scss from v2.x to v3.0.0

:::tip

After `3.0.0` your should run any successive versioned codemods for example:

- `3.1.0`: Migrate your project from v3.0.0 to v3.1.0

We will aim at introducing codemods between new versions to mitigate any
breaking changes, so when you update your project, also ensure that you follow
the the
[Automated Migration](/docs/3.x/upgrade/migration-guides/3.0-3.1#automated-migration)
posted in the Migration guides

:::

## Example

```shell
$ pnpm run front-commerce migrate --transform 3.0.0
```

## Notes

#### Manual Migration

There are some processes which can not be automatically migrated, in these cases
the codemods will add a `TODO (Codemod generated)` comment with a description of
the manual migration process above the code that needs to be manually migrated.
We invite you to search through your codebase for these comments and follow the
instructions.

#### SCSS Migration

As we move forward to a pure CSS approach, we have provided a codemod to help
you migrate your SCSS to pure CSS. As an example we have replaced SCSS functions
with CSS function, for example.

```scss
button {
  // remove-next-line
  width: math.div(100%, 2);
  // add-next-line
  width: calc(100% / 2);
}
```

The same applies for SCSS variables, for example

```scss
button {
  // remove-next-line
  width: $button-width;
  // add-next-line
  width: var(--button-width);
}
```

:::warning

After running the codemod, you will need to check your SCSS files to ensure **no
regression** has been introduced! We invite you to read the
[SCSS Migration Manual Migration Guide](/docs/3.x/migration/manual-migration#sass-migration)
