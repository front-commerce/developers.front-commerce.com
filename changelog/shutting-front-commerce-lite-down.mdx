We are shutting down Front-Commerce Lite, our open-source prototyping starter
kit for React eCommerce storefronts created back in 2018.

The reason is simple: we feel that in 2020 developers are now more aware about

<abbr title="Progressive Web Application">PWA</abbr> storefronts, React for
<abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr> and headless commerce. We think
that they could grasp the benefits of Front-Commerce by reading its documentation,
and experiment/prototype directly with Front-Commerce itself.

If **you** want to build a <abbr title="Proof of Concept">PoC</abbr> and create
usable, durable storefronts that increase sales we've got you covered with
Front-Commerce. We have everything ready to onboard new partners and build a PoC
within days!

## What was Front-Commerce Lite?

Front-Commerce Lite (_a.k.a_ "FCL") was a minimalist React/GraphQL eCommerce
application (Home page, product page and Cart). It allowed developers to start
experimenting with the code within minutes.

It demonstrated how a single React application could leverage GraphQL schema and
work no matter the headless eCommerce platform behind it. With examples and
prototypes built for Magento 2, Moltin, OroCommerce and several others we could
illustrate how GraphQL as a unified storefront API made sense way before it
became adopted by other solutions.

The React / GraphQL ecosystem (and tooling around it) drastically evolved since
we first created FCL, and it is now possible to recreate the same starter kit
with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and
[Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/#step-2-install-dependencies).

## Why was it created?

In 2017, when we explained Front-Commerce to developers, we often had to explain
why having a clear separation of concerns between the frontend application and
the server was a way to increase a team's efficiency.

At that time, for many developers used to traditional monolithic eCommerce
platforms, React was just "one of this new Javascript library that frontend
developers were excited about" and GraphQL "a new way to do REST". The
complexity of understanding the Javascript ecosystem from a PHP/HTML developer
was not worth it for them.

**We felt it was sad!** Sad to miss one of the biggest technical change in our
industry: headless commerce. Sad to miss the best way to build delightful
eCommerce experience: a user-centric Single Page Progressive Web Application.
Sad to miss one of the best way to keep a team motivated: use modern
technologies with a better developer experience. And finally, sad to miss the
business opportunity to work on bigger and more interesting projects!

Front-Commerce was already providing a way to solve all of these problems, and
we knew it because the first shops were about to go in production!

In 2018, we decided to create this starter kit so we could explain it and tell
developers to experiment by themselves! Marketing blog posts praising this new
industry shift, and use-cases from the biggest companies was nothing for a
developer compared to changing a few lines of code and seeing the UI updates
seamlessly.

## It brought value to many teams!

In 2018 and early 2019, we've paired with many developers at events to show them
the way, we are sure that many teams are now convinced that headless commerce
and PWA are the direction to follow. Some teams even chose to use Front-Commerce
in their first PWA/headless projects, could win deals against bigger agencies
and deliver the project on-time!

Front-Commerce Lite has also been used to quickly build prototypes to illustrate
the promise of such a stack to merchants who wanted to increase sales on mobile.

It was even useful for ourselves: we could experiment with new ideas and explore
API of headless platforms quickly, to demonstrate it could be supported by
Front-Commerce. This is for instance how we could then decide to build a
[Magento 1 GraphQL integration](/changelog/front-commerce-is-compatible-with-magento1/)
and several
[headless CMS integrations (Prismic, Wordpress) for Magento](/changelog/introducing-cms-demos/)
(and future platforms too).

## But Front-Commerce Lite was not Front-Commerce

For the past few years, we brought a lot of improvements to Front-Commerce
itself that could not be easily integrated in Front-Commerce Lite without
open-sourcing them.

Everything that makes Front-Commerce
[the best eCommerce storefront solution for production use](/docs/category/production-ready)
to date was still difficult for developers to understand. Some of them even made
the mistake to benchmark Front-Commerce Lite with other solutions… to finally
decide that Front-Commerce (not FCL!) was not relevant for their use case as it
was a mere glue between existing libraries.

By shutting down Front-Commerce Lite, we want to prevent this lack of
understanding and make it clear that **in 2020, Front-Commerce is still the best
solution out there for building an eCommerce Storefront PWA!** We encourage
developers to browse [Front-Commerce's documentation](/docs/welcome) and see
everything that Front-Commerce brings to the table.

For those who even started to experiment by themselves with eCommerce PWA, we
are sure that they will see the benefits. Here are a few examples:

- do you struggle to see how you could keep your theme up-to-date across
  releases? Front-Commerce
  [React theme overrides and fallbacks](/docs/essentials/extend-the-theme)
  allows you to keep duplication to its simplest (and also reuse code across
  projects)
- are you tired of ever-changing architectural choices in other solutions?
  Front-Commerce has been designed since day 1 around a GraphQL API as the only
  way for the application to interact with the different backend services. Our
  [GraphQL implementation is thus extremely modular and extensible](/docs/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema).
- wondering about
  [how to configure analytics tracking in a React application?](/docs/advanced/theme/analytics)
  Documented too!
- struggling with
  [integrating rich content from a CMS with a rich WYSIWYG or Page Builder?](/docs/advanced/theme/wysiwyg)
  Many Front-Commerce projects in production are already doing it!
- is security your thing?
  [We have docs for you!](/docs/advanced/graphql/rate-limiting)
- are you worried about our backward-compatibility policy? We hope that
  [our migration guides](/docs/appendices/migration-guides) will make you feel
  how committed we are to make your upgrades as seamless as possible.

These are just a few examples! We are
[continuously improving our documentation](https://github.com/front-commerce/developers.front-commerce.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
so power users could be autonomous and craft the best storefront possible, given
their own context.

Oh, and we also have
[many online demonstration instances](https://demo.front-commerce.com/) and
[shops in production](https://www.front-commerce.com/en/showcase/) if you want
to reassure SEO experts that Front-Commerce could actually improve SEO.

## What's next?

With Front-Commerce Lite being shut down, we also want to provide a way for
teams to have a chance to understand what Front-Commerce could bring to them as
a team!

In 2018, we thought it was important for developers and teams to understand
where the eCommerce market was going. **In 2020, we want to make teams
understand that this shift is not only a technological one.**

Front-Commerce will remains the best solution to build an eCommerce PWA: fully
supporting advanced features, stable and of course the fastest!

But please, **make sure you don't restrict Front-Commerce to the technology
behind it.** It is much more! We chose to build a product that will help you to
take advantage of this new way to do eCommerce. We want merchants to have a best
of breed approach and leverage the best domain services out there. For this, we
know how important it is to work with teams that could design consistent
services interactions and create User Experiences that leverage these technical
advantages.

Building a team that could perform well in UX, UI, architecture, frontend
development and knowing the different backend platforms very well is a tough
task. Front-Commerce helps you by providing guidance, pre-sales help, a
community of partners you could collaborate with and a consistent technical
product that will remain up-to-date… so your team could focus on bringing value!

## Conclusion
