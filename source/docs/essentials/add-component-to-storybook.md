title: Add a component to your Design system
description: Our goal with Front-Commerce is to give you the tools you need to develop a delightful user experience within your e-commerce shop. One of these tools is a Design System.
---

The concept lying behind a Design System is to document how your brand
communicates with its users. This goes from global guides such as "Voice and
tone", "Code Convention", "Accessibility"â€¦ to components documentation that
focus on where and how to use a specific component.

Such a Design System should be customized to the way your team(s) work and
should evolve according to your needs. But with Front-Commerce, we provide
you a base you can iterate on.

Technically, we use Storybook which is a tool that references `stories` for
each component you want to document. With these stories, it will launch for
you a website that allows you to browse through your components.

In this documentation we will go through a basic tutorial that gets you
started with writing stories within Front-Commerce. But if you want to learn
more about Storybook, please refer to
[their documentation](https://storybook.js.org/basics/writing-stories/).

<!-- TODO For more detailed information about Front-Commerce specific configurations of Storybook, please refer to TODO -->

## Add your own story

In order to add your own story, you need to create a new file, that will
document how to use a component and will reference each edge cases for this
component. Each case will be what we call a `story`.

As explained in
[Storybook's documentation](https://storybook.js.org/basics/writing-stories/):

<blockquote class="cite">
Technically, a story is a function that returns a React element.
</blockquote>

To do this, you will create a `.story.js` file next to your component. In this
example, we will use the same component as in
[Create a UI Component](create-a-ui-component.html)'s page:
`web/theme/components/molecules/IllustratedContent/IllustratedContent.js`. Hence,
your stories file will be in
`web/theme/components/molecules/IllustratedContent/IllustratedContent.story.js`
and will look like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import IllustratedContent from "./IllustratedContent.js";
import { storiesOf } from "@storybook/react";
import Icon from "theme/ui/atoms/Icon";
import { H3 } from "theme/ui/atoms/Typography/Heading";

storiesOf("components.molecules.IllustratedContent", module).add(
  "default",
  () => {
    return (
      <IllustratedContent media={<Icon icon="calendar-full" />}>
        <H3>Shipping within 48h</H3>
      </IllustratedContent>
    );
  }
);
```

Thanks to this file, when you will launch Storybook (`npm run styleguide`), it
will **register** the stories for the component `IllustratedContent`. It will
make it accessible in the Storybook's website under `components` > `molecules`
\> `IllustratedContent`. And if you click on the `default` story in the
navigation, it will display a default story which will show the standard usecase
of the `IllustratedContent` component.

<blockquote class="note">
As you might have noticed, once you have added the above `IllustratedContent`
story, if you edit the story or the component itself, it will update
automatically in Storybook (this feature is called hot reloading). It greatly improves the experience of authoring UI components.
</blockquote>

For now, we've registered only one story for the `IllustratedContent`. But you can
add more to better explain edge cases of your component. For instance you could
add a story with a very long content in order to better see how it will behave.

```diff
import React from "react";
import IllustratedContent from "./IllustratedContent.js";
import { storiesOf } from "@storybook/react";
import Icon from "theme/ui/atoms/Icon";
import { H3 } from "theme/ui/atoms/Typography/Heading";
+import Paragraph from "theme/ui/atoms/Typography/Paragraph";

storiesOf("components.molecules.IllustratedContent", module)
  .add("default", () => {
    <IllustratedContent media={<Icon icon="calendar-full" />}>
      <H3>Shipping within 48h</H3>
    </IllustratedContent>
- });
+  })
+  .add("with long content", () => {
+    return (
+      <IllustratedContent media={<Icon icon="calendar-full" />}>
+        <H3>Shipping within 48h</H3>
+        <Paragraph>
+          We are using many delivery services to let you choose what is best for
+          you!
+        </Paragraph>
+      </IllustratedContent>
+    );
+  });
```

This can be a nice and efficient way to show your designer how the
implementation will behave and ask for feedback to improve the User Experience.

## Add a new usecase to an existing story

There are some cases where the story already exists but you want to add a new
edge case. This will usually happen when you override a core component of
Front-Commerce and you want to update its story to document the new use case.

In this example, we will consider that you have overriden and updated the
`Button` component (as explained in [Extend the theme](extend-the-theme.html)) to
add a new type of button: `tertiary`.

To add this story, you will need to override the `Button.story.js` in the same
way you overrode the `Button.js`. This means that you should copy the existing
story from
[`node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/components/atoms/Button/Button.story.js`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/blob/main/src/web/theme/components/atoms/Button/Button.story.js)
to `my-module/web/theme/components/atoms/Button/Button.story.js`.

Once you have copied the file, you need to restart the Storybook with
`npm run styleguide`. There should be no change in Storybook's interface, but if
you add the following story in your newly created file, you should see a new
`tertiary` story appear in the navigation, that will display the tertiary button.

```diff
+  .add("tertiary", () => (
+    <Button
+      onClick={action("Button clicked")}
+      tertiary
+    >
+      Click!
+    </Button>
+  )
```

## Create stories for complex components

You now are able to customize your stories and document all your components.
However, you may stumble into more complex issues such as internationalisation,
routing and data fetching in some of your components.

But it is your lucky day! With Front-Commerce's components, we have had the same
issues and have created helpers that should make your life easier when
documenting those complex components.

These helpers are located in
[`node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/storybook/addons`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/tree/main/src/web/storybook/addons) and you can import them by
using the alias `web/storybook/addons/...`. For now, we have four of them:

- [`web/storybook/addons/apollo/ApolloDecorator`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/blob/main/src/web/storybook/addons/apollo/ApolloDecorator.js): mocks the data fetched by your
  components
- [`web/storybook/addons/form/formDecorator`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/blob/main/src/web/storybook/addons/form/formDecorator.js): mocks a Form surounding the input
  component you are documenting
- [`web/storybook/addons/intl/IntlDecorator`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/blob/main/src/web/storybook/addons/intl/IntlDecorator.js): allows you to switch between the
  languages of your shop
- [`web/storybook/addons/router/routerDecorator`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/blob/main/src/web/storybook/addons/router/routerDecorator.js): mocks the routing and the URLs of
  your application

<!-- TODO document usage of each of these helpers -->

## Display only the relevant stories to your Design System

If you run the styleguide for your own project, you may notice that
Front-Commerce comes with a lot of stories. This is what serves as
documentation Front-Commerce base theme's core components.

However, you might not use each one of them in your final theme, and some
stories might become irrelevant in your design system. To chose which one to
display, you need to update the `.front-commerce.js` configuration file, and
add the key [`styleguidePaths`](/docs/reference/front-commerce-js.html#styleguidePaths).

```diff
module.exports = {
  name: "Front Commerce Demo",
  url: "https://demo.front-commerce.com",
  modules: ["./my-module"],
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerceCore", path: "./modules/front-commerce-core" },
    { name: "Magento2", path: "./modules/magento2" },
    { name: "SampleBlog", path: "./model/blog" }
-  ]
+  ],
+  styleguidePaths: [
+    /.?\/components\/atoms\/.*.story.js$/,
+    /.?\/components\/molecules\/.*.story.js$/,
+  ]
};
```

The value is an array containing the regex that matches the stories you want
to use in your styleguide. In this example, we only want to display atoms and
molecules from our UI Components. But please remember that this will fetch
the stories within all the `web/theme` folder from [`modules` defined in
`.front-commerce.js`](/docs/reference/front-commerce-js.html#modules).

Hence, if you don't want to have an atom that is defined within
Front-Commerce core, but still want the other atoms, you will need to be more
specific within your [`styleguidePaths`](/docs/reference/front-commerce-js.html#styleguidePaths) array. For instance, if you only want
the `Typography` related stories, and the `Button` related stories, you will
need to write like this:

```diff
  styleguidePaths: [
-    /.?\/components\/atoms\/.*.story.js$/,
+    /.?\/components\/atoms\/Button\/.*.story.js$/,
+    /.?\/components\/atoms\/Typography\/.*.story.js$/,
    /.?\/components\/molecules\/.*.story.js$/,
  ]
```

Finally, if you don't define the [`styleguidePaths` key in your `.front-commerce.js` file](/docs/reference/front-commerce-js.html#styleguidePaths), each story found in the `web/theme` folder will be used.
