Grasping all the concepts around a product such as Front-Commerce is exciting
but can be intimidating. Therefore, we tried to create and organize this
documentation so that you could quickly find the information you need depending
on your context.

## Welcome to Front-Commerce’s official documentation

Even though Front-Commerce is a proprietary product, we have decided to maintain
our documentation in the open.

**It means that you could understand how the product works and see code samples,
to help you decide whether Front-Commerce is relevant for your project or not.**

It also means that you are encouraged to contribute to the documentation and
help us making it as good as possible. Keep
[Uncle Bob’s famous « Boy Scout Rule »](http://wiki.c2.com/?BoyScoutRule) in
mind… any contributions is welcome (fixing a typo, adding troubleshooting,
opening an issue to suggest new content).

Each page contains a direct « Edit on GitHub » link to allow you to quickly
suggest a change or fix typo/grammar mistakes while reading it.
