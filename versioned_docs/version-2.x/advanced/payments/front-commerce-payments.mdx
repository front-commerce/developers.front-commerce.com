With Front-Commerce payments, interactions occur from Front-Commerce
GraphQL/Node.js middleware so that remote systems (<abbr title="Order Management
System">OMS</abbr>, <abbr title="Enterprise resource planning">ERP</abbr>
softwaresâ€¦) will only receive Orders when they are paid.

These payment methods are also aimed at being as frictionless as possible for
Customers, so payment inputs are usually embedded in the checkout page to
prevent redirecting Customers to third-party providers. Per their nature follow
the
[Direct Order payment workflow](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/payment-workflows#direct-order).

## How is a Front-Commerce Payment method integrated with eCommerce platforms

Front-Commerce handle payments directly, without the need for a payment
integration in your eCommerce system. However, **Front-Commerce provides a
generic Payment method** tailored for your eCommerce platform so that you can
still benefit from its order management features and workflows.

From your eCommerce system's perspective, a payment made with Front-Commerce is
integrated in a similar way than checks / wire payments (sometimes named
"offline payment"). The difference is that Front-Commerce will update orders
statuses upon receiving automatic notifications from the payment service.
