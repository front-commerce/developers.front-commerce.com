<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

The `front-commerce-prepare.js` configuration file should leave at the root of
any web modules folder. Front-Commerce supports the keys detailed below:

## `onCreateRoute`

A function that transforms a `route` found in the modules defined in
[`.front-commerce.js:webModules`](/docs/2.x/reference/front-commerce-js#webmodules).

See [Routing reference](/docs/2.x/reference/routing#how-routes-are-loaded) for
details about the terms used.

### Parameters

- `route`: an object with the following properties:
  - `fromModule` (string): path of the web module defining the current route
  - `filepath` (string): absolute path to the route file
  - `path` (string): `path` that will be used for mapping URLs to this file (see
    [Routing reference](/docs/2.x/reference/routing#how-routes-are-loaded) for
    details)
  - `isLayout` (bool): Is the file a `_layout.js`?
  - `isLayoutAddition` (bool): Is the file a layout customization? (`_error.js`
    or `_inner-layout.js`)
  - `isRoute` (bool): Is the file a route (= neither a layout nor a layout
    addition)

### Return value

An optional route object with the following keys:

- `fromModule` (string): path of the web module defining the current route
- `filepath` (string): absolute path to the route file
- `path` (string): `path` that will be used for mapping URLs to this file (see
  [Routing reference](/docs/2.x/reference/routing#how-routes-are-loaded) for
  details)

If no route is returned, the route is ignored.

### Example:

```js
module.exports.onCreateRoute = (route) => {
  // Remove all the `/contact/` pages
  if (route.path === "/contact/") {
    return null;
  }

  return route;
};
```
