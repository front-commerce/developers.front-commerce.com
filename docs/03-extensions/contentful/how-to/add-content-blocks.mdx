# Content Blocks

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

## Prerequisites

To create a Block library, you will require a library of exposed
[ContentTypes](./add-content-types) in your GraphQL schema.

## How to use Blocks?

Integrating a Content Blocks Zones into your project is a 2 steps process:

- [Create a Block library](#create-a-block-library)
  - [Independent components for each Block type](#independent-components-for-each-block-type)
  - [Define the Block library](#define-the-block-library)
- [Retrieve and display the content](#retrieve-and-display-the-content)

## Create a Block library

To ease the creation of a Block Library, Front-Commerce provides the
`makeContentBlockLibrary` function. It allows developers to create a library of
Blocks for the GraphQL types declared with [ContentTypes](./add-content-types).

### Independent components for each Block type

First, ensure that you have created one or more components for each Block type
to display. Each one of them must have a GraphQL fragment defining the data they
require.

A component **must accept** data of the fragment attached to it in `props.data`.
Here is an example for a `BlockTitleText` to be used the Home Block library

```jsx title="theme/modules/Blocks/BlockTitleText/BlockTitleText.js"
const BlockTitleText = (props) => {
  const { subtitle, title, align = "center" } = props.data;

  return (
    <Container>
      <div className="block-title-text">
        {title && ( // we always check if the value is defined as "draft" data might not yet have the title set.
          <h2 className={`block-title-text__title alignment-${align}`}>
            {title}
          </h2>
        )}
        {subtitle && ( // same here, we should always ensure it is defined before using it.
          <h3 className={`block-title-text__subtitle alignment-${align}`}>
            {subtitle}
          </h3>
        )}
      </div>
    </Container>
  );
};

export default BlockTitleText;
```

and the related GraphQL fragment describing data dependencies:

```graphql title="theme/modules/Blocks/BlockTitleText/BlockTitleTextFragment.gql"
fragment BlockTitleTextFragment on BlockTitleText {
  title
  subtitle
  align
}
```

Then we can export these in the `index.js` file of the block:

```js title="theme/modules/Blocks/BlockTitleText/index.js"
export { default as BlockTitleText } from "./BlockTitleText";
// We will also need the fragment to create the block library, explained below
export { BlockTitleTextFragmentFragmentDocument } from "~/graphql/graphql";
```

### Define the Block library

Several components and their fragments can now be assembled together in a Block
library. Here is how to achieve this with the `makeContentBlockLibrary` factory:

```js title="theme/modules/Blocks/Home/index.js"
import { makeContentBlockLibrary } from "@front-commerce/contentful/react";

import {
  BlockTitleText,
  BlockTitleTextFragmentFragmentDocument,
} from "theme/modules/Blocks/BlockTitleText";
import {
  BlockTextImage,
  BlockTextImageFragmentFragmentDocument,
} from "theme/modules/Blocks/BlockTextImage";

// "HomePageBlock" is the name of the GraphQL union type exposing the Block Library
const blockLibrary = makeContentBlockLibrary("HomePageBlock", [
  { component: BlockTitleText, fragment: BlockTitleTextFragment },
  {
    component: BlockTextImage,
    fragment: BlockTextImageFragmentFragmentDocument,
  },
]);

// This export must be left unchanged. It allows the file to be imported
// as a Fragment in a `*.gql` file.
// The generated fragment will have the GraphQL type name, suffixed with "Fragment".
// In this example, it will be: HomePageBlockFragment
export const definitions = blockLibrary.fragmentDefinitions;

// This ContentBlock component is the one that will display data correctly
export default blockLibrary.ContentBlock;
```

:::info important

The `export const definitions` is required to allow importing this file as a
GraphQL fragment (see below).

## Retrieve and display the content

Now that you have defined a Block library, you could use it wherever you need to
display a BlockLibrary with these Blocks.

Let's continue our example and update our hypothetical `<Home>` component to
display the Block library.

First, update the GraphQL query to add the Block library field (`mainContent` in
our example)

```graphql title="theme/pages/Home/HomeQuery.gql"
#import "theme/modules/Blocks/Home"
query HomeQuery {
  homepage {
    mainContent {
      ...HomePageBlockFragment
    }
  }
}
```

Then, update the `<Home>` component to display the content:

```jsx title="theme/pages/Home/Home.js"
// add-next-line
import HomeBlockLibrary from "theme/modules/Blocks/Home";
// [â€¦]

const Home = (props) => {
  const homepageData = props.data.homepage;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{homepageData.title}</h1>
      // add-start
      <HomeBlockLibrary
        content={homepageData.mainContent}
        renderBlocks={(blocks) => <Stack size="8">{blocks}</Stack>}
      />
      // add-end
    </div>
  );
};
```

:::note

The `renderBlocks` prop is optional. it allows to add a container around the
blocks. In this example, we use the `Stack` component from Front-Commerce's
`web/theme/components/atoms/Layout/Stack` to display the blocks vertically.

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰ You can now try to create new Blocks in Contentful or reorder
them, and your page should reflect these changes after publication.
