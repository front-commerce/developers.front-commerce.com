title: Translate your application
description:
  International e-commerce websites often need to translate their UI into
  several languages to make sure that they reach a broader range of customers.
  This documentation will show how this works for static content in your
  application.

If you want to configure your application to support multiple languages, please

Front-Commerce manages your translations by using
[`react-intl`](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl), a standard library in the
React ecosystem. This library works by transforming your static values in React
Components. These components will then fetch your translations and display them
in your application.

## Declare translations in your application

For instance, let's see how to transform your values in `react-intl` Components.

### Strings

```jsx
import { FormattedMessage } from "react-intl";

<FormattedMessage
  id="My.Component.Id.messageId"
  defaultMessage="Default translation"
/>;
```

### Dates

```jsx
import { FormattedDate } from "react-intl";

<FormattedDate value={date} year="numeric" month="long" day="2-digit" />;
```

### Prices

```jsx
import { FormattedNumber } from "react-intl";

<FormattedNumber
  value={value.amount}
  style="currency"
  currency={value.currency}
/>;
```

:::note

However, for this particular use case we have abstracted this in Front-Commerce
with the
[`theme/components/atoms/Price`](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/tree/main/src/web/theme/components/atoms/Typography/Price)
component (and its variants: `ProductPrice`, `PriceOrFree`). We recommend you to
use it instead, so you could benefit from better integration with its related
GraphQL Type.

:::

You can find the full set of components in the
[React Intl Components documentation](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/components/)

### Without React Component

These components will be enough in most cases. However, the issue with these is
that it wraps your string within a React Element, which may be troublesome when
you actually need to handle the string itself.

For instance, this is the case when you want to add some label attributes to
your <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> elements.

```jsx
<span class="icon" aria-label="Icon title displayed for screen readers" />
```

Fortunately, this is correctly handled by `react-intl` if you use
[`defineMessages`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/api/#definemessagesdefinemessage)
combined with
[`injectIntl HOC`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/upgrade-guide-3x/#new-useintl-hook-as-an-alternative-of-injectintl-hoc)
or the [`useIntl hook`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/api/#useintl-hook).

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="useIntl Hook">
```

You can learn more about hooks in the
[react documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro).

```jsx
import { defineMessages, useIntl } from "react-intl";

const messages = defineMessages({
  ariaLabel: {
    id: "screen-reader-icon-title",
    defaultMessage: "Icon title displayed for screen readers",
  },
});

const MyComponentWithHook = (props) => {
  const intl = useIntl();
  return (
    <span class="icon" aria-label={intl.formatMessage(messages.ariaLabel)} />
  );
};
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="injectIntl HOC">
```

You can learn more about <abbr title="Higher-Order Components">HOC</abbr>'s in
the [react documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components).

```jsx
import { defineMessages, injectIntl } from "react-intl";

const messages = defineMessages({
  ariaLabel: {
    id: "screen-reader-icon-title",
    defaultMessage: "Icon title displayed for screen readers",
  },
});

const MyComponentWithHOC = injectIntl(({ intl, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <span class="icon" aria-label={intl.formatMessage(messages.ariaLabel)} />
  );
});
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Translate what's in your components

Now that you have defined what should be translated in your application, you
actually need to translate your application. This is a two-step process:

1. Run the following script that will fetch all your translatable strings in
   your application and gather them in a JSON file located in
   `translations/[locale].json`

   ```shell
   npm run translate
   ```

2. Translate the strings available in those files, and you are good to go ðŸ™‚

   :::tip ProTipâ„¢

   <!-- TODO - add example of BabelEdit -->

   You can use tools like [BabelEdit](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit) to
   help translate and keep your translations in sync.

   :::

Note that for some translations you won't need to change anything. This usually
happens for the default language and for business phrases such as "SKU", etc.

However, `react-intl` will warn you against those cases because it might be an
actual translation that is missing. Luckily, you can opt-out of this warning for
specific translations ids by adding it to the
`translations/whitelist_[locale].json` file.

This task can be daunting at first, but it will make your life easier in the
future when you will need to know which string was not translated in a recent
update.

### Translations fallback

With `react-intl` translations are usually grouped into a single file. In our
case, we would expect them to be in `translations/[locale].json`. But in
Front-Commerce's case, we don't want you to be troubled by translations that are
handled by the core.

That's why Front-Commerce uses a mechanism called **translations fallbacks**.
Instead of relying on a single file for translations, Front-Commerce will look
out for translations in the following locations and pick the ones that exist:

#### Front-Commerce core

- `node_modules/front-commerce/translations/[short-locale].json` or
- `node_modules/front-commerce/translations/[locale].json`

#### from your modules [declared in `.front-commerce.js`](/docs/reference/front-commerce-js#modules)

- `<my-module>/translations/[short-locale].json` or
- `<my-module>/translations/[locale].json`

#### from your project

- `translations/[short-locale].json` or
- `translations/[locale].json`

`[short-locale]` here means that we are only taking the first particle of the
`locale`. E.g. if the locale was `en-GB`, the short-locale would be `en`. That's
how `en-GB` would load translations from both `en.json` and `en-GB.json` files.

If a translation key is defined in multiple files, the last one (according to
the above list) will be be used. This is especially useful if you want to change
the core's translations.

:::tip ProTipâ„¢

You can see exactly which translation files are used by opening the files
located in `.front-commerce/translations/`.

:::

Please keep in mind that when you run `npm run translate`, new keys will be
added to `translations/[locale].json`. However, if you are developing a module
it can make sense to add the translations to
`<my-module>/translations/[locale].json`. You can do this by using
`npm run translate -- -m <my-module>`.

## About dynamic content

`react-intl` lets you translate your static content. But what about dynamic
content? Things like product title and description, CMS pages, etc.

This is done on the GraphQL side. The principle is that when a user is connected
to Front-Commerce, they will be assigned a `storeViewCode` in their session (see
[Configure multiple stores](/docs/advanced/production-ready/multistore) for more
details).

This code will then be used by your GraphQL loaders to retrieve the correct
content from your backend. Learn more about
[GraphQL loaders](/docs/advanced/graphql/slim-down-resolvers-with-loaders).
