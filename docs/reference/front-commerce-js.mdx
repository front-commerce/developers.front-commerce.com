  The .front-commerce.js configuration file at the root of a Front-Commerce
  project is the main entry point defining how an application behaves. This page
  documents its different configuration keys.
---

<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

From the `.front-commerce.js` definition, Front-Commerce will initialize and
register the different pieces composing your application.

## `name`

The application name.

```js
module.exports = {
  name: "ACME shop",
  // […]
};
```

This name is used for _Developer Experience_ only and is not aimed at appearing
in the theme or any website user message.

It is for instance used as title in the
[Storybook design system](/docs/essentials/add-component-to-storybook).

## `url`

The project URL.

```js
module.exports = {
  // […]
  url: "https://github.com/acme/shop/",
  // […]
};
```

This url is used for _Developer Experience_ only and is not aimed at appearing
in the theme or any website user message. You may thus use it to redirect to
your staging instance, or project management tool for instance.

It is for instance used as the link target for the name in the
[Storybook design system](/docs/essentials/add-component-to-storybook).

:::note

Use
[the `FRONT_COMMERCE_URL` environment variable](/docs/reference/environment-variables#host)
to configure the URL used to access to your application.

:::

## `modules`

A list of path to Front-Commerce modules to register in your application.

```js
module.exports = {
  // […]
  modules: ["./acme-common", "./src", "./winter", "./christmas"],
  // […]
};
```

Each module can contain client code to
[extend the theme](/docs/essentials/extend-the-theme), and server code to
[add custom server endpoints](/docs/advanced/server/add-http-endpoint).

:::note

Front-Commerce modules are registered in the order they appear in this list.
**The default Front-Commerce theme will always be registered first and must not
appear in this list.**

:::

In the above example, a `component/Foo` component would be resolved according to
theme overrides in the following order (the first existing one would be used):

1. `./christmas/component/Foo`
1. `./winter/component/Foo`
1. `./src/component/Foo`
1. `./acme-common/component/Foo`
1. `front-commerce/src/web/theme/component/Foo`

## `serverModules`

A list of objects describing GraphQL modules to register in your application.
GraphQL modules allows you to
[extend the GraphQL schema](/docs/essentials/extend-the-graphql-schema).

```js
module.exports = {
  // […]
  serverModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerceCore", path: "server/modules/front-commerce-core" },
    { name: "Magento2", path: "server/modules/magento2" },
  ],
  // […]
};
```

Each object must be composed of the properties below:

- `name`: unique key that must be unique across the `serverModules` list. It is
  a temporary name that is used during a code generation step and has no other
  usage in the application. _Do not worry about it, it will be deprecated in a
  near future: see
  [#179](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/179)
  for further information._

- `path`: must be a path to the
  [GraphQL module definition file](/docs/reference/graphql-module-definition)

:::info

GraphQL modules will be loaded according to the
[`dependencies` declared in their respective definitions](/docs/reference/graphql-module-definition#dependencies-optional).
The order in the `serverModules` list should **NOT** be relied on for dependency
management.

:::

As of the latest release, Front-Commerce’s provides the following GraphQL
modules (or [meta-modules](/docs/advanced/graphql/meta-modules)):

- `server/modules/front-commerce-core`: core features of Front-Commerce.
- `server/modules/magento2` _(meta module)_: Magento2 GraphQL modules to
  [use Front-Commerce with all Magento2 supported features](/docs/category/magento2).
  Register single sub-modules explicitly if you only need a subset of features.
- [Front-Commerce’s embedded payment](/docs/category/checkout) modules:
  - `server/modules/payment-ogone`: Ogone payment platform.
  - `server/modules/payment-paypal`: PayPal payment platform.
  - `server/modules/payment-payzen`: PayZen payment platform.

<!-- TODO Add links to each embedded payment documentation page when available -->

## `webModules`

A list of objects describing the web modules to register in your application.
Web modules allow you to register new routes in your application by using the
filesystem. In the long run, it will be the main entrypoint to inject code
through extension points in Front-Commerce.

```js
module.exports = {
  // […]
  webModules: [
    { name: "FrontCommerce", path: "front-commerce/src/web" },
    { name: "Magento2", path: "./src/web" },
  ],
  // […]
};
```

Each object must be composed of the properties below:

- `name`: unique key that must be unique across the `webModules` list. It is a
  temporary name that is used during a code generation step and has no other
  usage than debugging.

- `path`: must be a path to the web module definition file, which is for now
  **an empty js file**. In the long run, it will allow you to define the
  extensions you are willing to support. In practice, we're using
  `require.resolve(webModule.path)` which will check for a file using node's
  resolver. This is why in most case, we are writing `src/web` but leaving aside
  `index.js`.

:::info

Web modules priority is defined by the order you are setting in the `webModules`
array. The later, the more important.

:::

The only functionality relying on `webModules` currently is the Routing. You can
refer to the following pages for more information:

- Guide: [Add a new page](/docs/essentials/add-a-page-client-side)
- Guide: [Layouts](/docs/advanced/theme/layouts)
- Reference: [Routing](/docs/reference/routing)

## `styleguidePaths`

_Default value: `[ /.*.story.js$/ ]`_

A list of regexes that match the Storybook stories you want to use in your
styleguide, so you can
[only display relevant stories in your Design System](/docs/essentials/add-component-to-storybook#display-only-the-relevant-stories-to-your-design-system).

```js
module.exports = {
  // […]
  styleguidePaths: [
    /.?\/components\/atoms\/Button\/.*.story.js$/,
    /.?\/components\/atoms\/Typography\/.*.story.js$/,
    /.?\/components\/molecules\/.*.story.js$/,
    /.?\/(pages|modules)\/.*.story.js$/,
  ],
  // […]
};
```

:::info

Stories matching this pattern will be fetched across the `web/theme` folder of
every [Front-Commerce `modules` defined](#modules) in the `.front-commerce.js`
file.

:::

## `build`

An object containing configurations for your build pipeline.

### `build.include`

Allows you to define which files should be parsed by webpack. This is especially
useful when you have some library which uses javascript features not yet
supported by the browsers you support.

You can either set it to:

- an array of paths
- a function which will allow you to transform the default include list by
  adding/removing the paths you need. It should return an array of paths.

Each path must be absolute. One way to do so is to use the following method:

```js
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  build: {
    include: [path.dirname(require.resolve("react-intl/package.json"))],
  },
};
```
