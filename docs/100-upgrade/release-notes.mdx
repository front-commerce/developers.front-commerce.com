## 3.0.0 (2023-09-28)

We are excited to introduce Front-Commerce 3.0, a big leap forward in e-commerce
development. With a focus on web performance, developer experience, and
adherence to web standards, this release is set to redefine how you approach
building your online storefronts.

Front-Commerce is a storefront for headless commerce based on the newly released
Remix v2 framework. We're bringing all the goodness we developed over the past 7
years, to the Remix ecosystem.

In this release, we've merged both technologies to enhance the experience for
end users and developers alike.
