## Pushing Prismic to the next level: previews and improvements, Algolia available for Magento2 and a new PSP at hand for Front-Commerce (spoiler: itâ€™s HiPay)

What a way to start the year! It's when we look back at the past 6 weeks that we
realize how much we can accomplish. Read on to discover version 2.13 and the
Front-Commerce news.

To begin, we would like to give a warm welcome to GaÃ«tan ðŸ‘‹, who joined the team
in February! We now have a team of 6 wizard developers working to help you
create seamless headless experiences.

This first part of the year was also the opportunity to start laying the bricks
for major projects. With the development of a new BigCommerce connector on one
hand, and the acceleration of our cloud offering with the implementation of
Akamai on the other. Our goal is to help you follow your site's activity and
help us follow your growth.

Concerning the release:

- You will now be able to use the HiPay PSP for Front-Commerce with first
  payment methods
- Benefit from the functionalities of the Algolia search tool for Magento 2!
- We also worked on the social login and registering feature with Google and
  Facebook, to allow your users to create their account and to connect more
  quickly (beta version)
- Finally, we have made our Prismic module evolve with new features that will
  certainly interest you ...

Youâ€™ll find all the details below ðŸ‘€

Should you have any requests regarding the product roadmap, do not hesitate to

## Prismic: we are now on v6 and previews are available!

During this release, we have worked on our existing
[Prismic](https://prismic.io/) module to make it even more powerful and
performant!

The [Prismic Previews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0zt9mzaF_g) feature is
now available for Front-Commerce, allowing you to view draft documents live on
your website without publishing them publicly: it is a huge step for creative
teams using Prismic for Front-Commerce and weâ€™re thrilled to launch this highly
demanded feature.

[Migrating Prismic from v4 to v6](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/prismic-client-v6-migration-guide)
offers many advantages: more intuitive API names and options, new
`queryByType()` and `queryByTag()` methods, fetch all documents with `getAll*`
queries, first-class TypeScript support. It was normal for us to help you get
all the power from this migration!

With our new developments regarding Prismic, you will be able to have articles
containing multiple relative content and retrieve all articles related to this
content: useful when you have a substantial content strategy ðŸ¤™

## Beta: Social login and registering: try it out and give us your feedback!

This is a feature that is becoming more and more standard on websites that
require account creation. With the 2.13 release, you will be able to offer your
users the possibility to create their account and log in using their Facebook or
Google credentials, allowing them to save time and not have to create and remind
a new password.

The social login module is currently flagged as beta. It works and is production
ready, but we want to tackle some technical refactoring that may change the way
it is used in a project (minor breaking changes).

We are also opened to feedbacks from the first users of this feature. You can
integrate it right now and give us your feedback on how it works for your use
case and ideas of improvements!

## Algolia and Magento2 for Front-Commerce: pushing your search capabilities to the next level!

Algolia, which has
[become a unicorn in 2021](https://www.usine-digitale.fr/article/algolia-le-google-des-entreprises-leve-150-millions-de-dollars.N1129259),
has become a key player regarding website search. We have been convinced of this
for a long time, having developed an Algolia connector for Magento 1
[from our version 2.5](/changelog/front-commerce-2.5/).

Now, Algolia is also available on Front-Commerce for Magento 2! You will be able
to use it to search categories, CMS pages and products of your e-commerce site,
or use Algolia datasource to fetch all CMS pages.

We will continue to enrich the Front-Commerce functionalities linked to Algolia,
especially by exploring the
[Algolia recommend](https://www.algolia.com/products/recommendations/) features,
which should allow to considerably improve the personalization of the user
experience.

## HiPay: a brand new PSP available for Front-Commerce

HiPay has become a must as part of the decision making process when a PSP
(Payment Service Provider) has to be chosen by a web-merchant or an integrator,
along with [Adyen](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/adyen),
[Paypal](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/paypal),
[Stripe](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/stripe) or
[Lyra](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/payzen).

It is now available in Front-Commerce, with the first payment methods enabled:
MasterCard, VISA, American Express and Bancontact. We will enable Apple Pay in
the next version. What other payment methods would you like to activate for
HiPay? Feel free to contact us to discuss this â˜•

[documentation](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/stripe#front-commerce-payment) or

## Our B2B demo is online: check it out!

Along our existing demos, we have put online our B2B demo, following the work of
our [2.12](/changelog/front-commerce-2.12/) and
[2.11](/changelog/front-commerce-2.11/) versions, during which we have explored
and developed most of the B2B dedicated features for Adobe Commerce B2B

## Other changes

### Bug fixes

- **magento1:** improve url matcher resilience for not found products or
  categories
- **sitemap:** fixed a regression from 2.12 preventing to generate the sitemap
  for Magento2 stores with CMS pages
- **search:** it is now possible to have no search datasource enabled at all in
  the project without errors. It now returns empty results.
- **orders:** the guest orders page (visible using the order id and email) is
  now restricted to the store the order has been placed on in Magento2
  multi-store contexts
- **styleguide:** the ProductGallery story can now be displayed again in theme
  chocolatine

### Performance Improvements

- **cache:** the Product gallery query now has same cache policy than the
  product page
- **cache:** we ensured that the MiniCart was never loaded during SSR to prevent
  `no-store` headers being sent in some contexts

### Features

- **dx:** the reason preventing to send Cache-Control headers is now displayed
  when using `DEBUG=front-commerce:cache`
- **bigcommerce:** weâ€™ve kickstarted the versioning of the module adding
  BigCommerce support in Front-Commerce. Details coming in the next releases.
