## Front-Commerce

[After installing the Algolia package](/docs/3.x/extensions/algolia/#installation),
you need to enable the corresponding extension. For that, you need to tweak your
`front-commerce.config.ts` file like:

```typescript title="front-commerce.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/config";
import themeChocolatine from "@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine";
import magento2 from "@front-commerce/magento2";
// highlight-next-line
import algolia from "@front-commerce/algolia";
import storesConfig from "./app/config/stores";
import cacheConfig from "./app/config/caching";

export default defineConfig({
  extensions: [
    // highlight-next-line
    algolia("standalone"), // ⚠️ need to be before magento2() or magento1()
    magento2({ storesConfig }), // or magento1()
    themeChocolatine(),
  ],
  stores: storesConfig,
  cache: cacheConfig,
  configuration: {
    providers: [],
  },
});
```

<a name="algolia-standalone-env"></a>
In the .env, you need to define the following environment variables:

```bash title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=APP_ID
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY=SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME_PREFIX=myproject_
```

<a name="algolia-standalone-config"></a>

To further configure the Algolia module for instance to define facets, you have
[to create a configuration provider to override](/docs/3.x/guides/configuration/add-a-configuration-provider)
[the `algoliaConfigProvider`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/871107f4f1c8c4acc88b555efa54f1d264227bf5/modules/datasource-algolia/server/config/algoliaConfigProvider.js).

## Indices requirements

In that kind of setup, you need to implement your own indexing mechanism to
replace the one provided by the Algolia module for Magento. To help you in that
task, we provide a script to check that the indices are compatible with
Front-Commerce. This script can be run with the following command:

```bash
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=APPID \
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_API_KEY=ADMIN_API_KEY \
FRONT_COMMERCE_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME_PREFIX=INDEX_NAME_PREFIX \
pnpm check-indices
```

The application ID and the admin API can be found in your Algolia account. The
index name prefix is a prefix of the indices that Front-Commerce will use. The
value on the command line should be the same as the one used
[to configure the Algolia module](#algolia-standalone-env).

By default, Front-Commerce is able to search for products, categories and CMS
pages, the corresponding indices need to follow some requirements.

For product indices:

- the indices name must be named after the following pattern:
  `{index_name_prefix}{store_code}_products`. For instance, in a setup where the
  index name is `myproject_` and Front-Commerce is configured to expose 2 stores
  which codes are `mystore` and `mystore2`, two indices named
  `myproject_mystore_products` and `myproject_mystore2_products` must be
  created;
- to be able to sort results by a field, some extra indices must be created by
  following the same naming convention and by adding a suffix using the pattern
  `_{sort_field}_asc` or `_{sort_field}_desc`. For instance, to allow sorting by
  created date (field `created_at`) ascending and descending, the indices
  `myproject_mystore_products_created_at_asc` and
  `myproject_mystore_products_created_at_desc` must exist;
- all documents must have a field `sku` and it must be retrievable `sku`. The
  field must contain the product `sku` as a string and for configurable product
  it should be an array of the SKUs of each configuration with the first one
  being the `sku` of the configurable product;
- all documents must have a field `category_ids`, this field must be searchable
  and configured as an attribute for facets. It must contain the category ids in
  which the product is positioned;
- all documents must have a field `price` where the price is represented as an
  object like

```json
{ "EUR": { "default": 42 }, "USD": { "default": 40 } }
```

:::note

`category_ids` is the only required facets. Depending on your project, you can
configure others facets in the index. For those facets to be taken into,
[you also have to configure the Algolia module](#algolia-standalone-config).

:::

For categories indices:

- the indices name must be named after the following pattern:
  `{index_name_prefix}{store_code}_categories`. For instance, in a setup where
  the index name is `myproject_` and Front-Commerce is configured to expose 2
  stores which codes are `mystore` and `mystore2`, two indices named
  `myproject_mystore_categories` and `myproject_mystore2_categories` must be
  created;
- the `objectID` field of each document must be the category id as a string.

For CMS page indices:

- the indices name must be named after the following pattern:
  `{index_name_prefix}{store_code}_pages`. For instance, in a setup where the
  index name is `myproject_` and Front-Commerce is configured to expose 2 stores
  which codes are `mystore` and `mystore2`, two indices named
  `myproject_mystore_pages` and `myproject_mystore2_pages` must be created.
- all documents must have a `slug` field identifying the corresponding CMS page.
  This field must be set as retrievable.

## Further customizations

In the `standalone` _flavor_, the Algolia extension relies on default
configuration settings. To customize it, you need
[to inject a specific configurations](/docs/3.x/guides/configuration/add-a-configuration-provider).
For that, you can create a dedicated extension that registers a configuration
provider.

[The example extension `custom-algolia-search`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/main/skeleton/example-extensions/custom-algolia-search)
shows how the index prefix can be manipulated, in that example the current shop
locale is added to it.

## Test it

To make sure Algolia APIs and indices are properly used, you can restart
Front-Commerce with the `DEBUG` environment variable containing
`front-commerce:algolia` so that it displays various information on the
requests:

```bash title="Run Front-Commerce with Algolia's debug flag"
DEBUG=front-commerce:algolia pnpm run dev
```

After restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able to run a GraphQL query to
search for products, categories or pages, for instance:

```graphql title="http://localhost:4000/graphql"
query Search {
  search(query: "whatever you want to search for") {
    query
    products(params: { from: 0, size: 5 }) {
      total
      products {
        sku
        name
      }
    }
    categories(size: 5) {
      name
    }
    pages(size: 5) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```
