## Understanding theme overrides

Front-Commerce web application is a fully featured e-commerce
[universal](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9)
React application aimed at providing a sane base for your own theme. Even though
you could reuse pages and components individually in a totally different theme,
most of the time you might find easier and faster to start with the base theme
and iterate from there.

**Theme override is what allows you to:**

- customize the base theme,
- customize how an extension is displayed,
- upgrade Front-Commerce and benefit from the latest component improvements,
- or create a slightly different theme for the Black Friday in confidence!

Having an understanding of
[themes in Magento](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/frontend-dev-guide/templates/template-overview.html),
[child themes in Wordpress](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/)
/
[Prestashop](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/themes/reference/template-inheritance/parent-child-feature/),
[templates override in Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming/twig/working-with-twig-templates),
[themes in CakePHP](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/views/themes.html) will help
you understand Front-Commerce’s theme overrides because they all share the same
philosophy. If you have no previous experience with these other implementations,
let’s see how it works!

Your own theme will be located in its own folder and will use default components
from parent theme(s) — at least from Front-Commerce base theme. You would then
copy the files you want to override in your theme folder by maintaining an
identical file structure. Your component will then be used instead of the one in
your parent theme(s).

This translates in those three steps:

1. configure your custom theme and use it in your application
2. copy the file (`js`, `scss` or `gql`) you want to override in the `theme`
   folder of your module
3. customize its content in your module directory

## Configure your custom theme and use it in your application

First, we need to create a minimalist module that will contain your own theme by
creating the following file structure (for instance at the root of your
project):

```
my-module
└── web
    └── theme
```

Then, we need to tell Front-Commerce that this module exists in your
[`.front-commerce.js`](/docs/reference/front-commerce-js) file. If the module
has been created at the root of your project, it would look like this:

```diff title="./front-commerce.js"
module.exports = {
  name: "Front Commerce",
  url: "http://www.front-commerce.test",
- modules: ["./src"],
+ modules: ["./src", "./my-module"],
  ...
};
```

Restart the application. That’s it! You have successfully registered the module
in your Front-Commerce application.

## Override a component

Let's add the description of a `Product` to a `ProductItem` as an example of
overriding the base theme.

The original file is:
[`node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItem.js`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/blob/main/src/web/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItem.js)

:::info

Please refer to the
[Front-Commerce’s folder structure documentation page](/docs/concepts/front-commerce-folder-structure)
to get a better understanding of how components are organized in the base theme.

:::

1. copy it to:
   `my-module/web/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItem.js`
2. add the description after the `<ProductOverview />` component in your
   `ProductItem` with `{this.props.description}`.

**But you are not done yet!** The `description` information is not included in
the GraphQL fields fetched by the application in the base theme. You will thus
need to update the fragment related to `ProductItem`.

The original fragment file is collocated with the original component at:

1. copy the
   [`original ProductItemFragment`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/blob/main/src/web/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItemFragment.gql)
   to the equivalent location in your module.
1. add the field `description` to the fragment.

   ```diff title="my-module/web/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItemFragment.gql"
   fragment ProductItemFragment on Product {
     imageUrl
   + description
     ...ProductOverviewFragment
     ...ProductItemActionsFragment
   }
   ```

1. restart the application

The data will now be fetched from GraphQL every time the `ProductItem` is used
(product listings, upsells…) and will be available for you to render it as
wanted.

:::caution

In development mode, you MIGHT need to restart the application for the override
to be detected. The tools used to provide the override feature do not detect
automatically that you're trying to override a file yet. This is an upcoming
improvement, see
[#63](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/63)
for further information.

:::

### Reuse the original component

Front-Commerce has been designed with small components having a single
responsibility. **We believe that theme overrides should cover most of your use
cases**. For some features though, it appeared that reusing the base component
could be really useful. For instance, if you want to add a small feature or
wrapper without changing the core feature of a component.

It is possible to import a component from the `front-commerce` node module in a
standard way, as you would import components from other libraries.

:::note

**Use with care!** We don't think that this method should be the default one,
because it can make your updates more painful.

:::

In the file that we've created in the previous section, instead of copying the
original source file you could set it up like this:

```jsx title="my-module/web/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItem.js"
import React from "react";

// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-imports (ESLint rule added in 2.19.0)
import BaseProductItem from "front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItem.js";

const ProductItem = (props) => (
  <div>
    {/* Add your feature here */}
    <BaseProductItem {...props} />
  </div>
);

export default ProductItem;
```
