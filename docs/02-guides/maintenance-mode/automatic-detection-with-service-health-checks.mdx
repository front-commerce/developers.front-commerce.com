# Health Checks

Health checks allow you to monitor the availability of your services and
automatically put your store in maintenance mode if a service is down. This
ensures that your users are not affected by a service outage.

With health checks, you can define a set of services that you want to monitor
and provide a function to check the health of each service. Front-Commerce will
periodically run these health check functions and if a service is down, it will
automatically put the store in maintenance mode. Once the service is back up,
the Front-Commerce will automatically remove the store from maintenance mode.

Additionally, you can configure the scheduling of the health checks using a Cron
pattern. This allows you to control how often the health checks are run and how
quickly your store is put in maintenance mode if a service is down.

:::info

When Maintenance Mode has been activated manually via
[the maintenance mode API](./entering-and-exiting-maintenance-mode#the-maintenance-mode-api),
the health checks will not remove the store from maintenance mode even after a
service has recovered. To remove the store from maintenance mode, you must
[manually deactivate](./entering-and-exiting-maintenance-mode#deactivating-the-maintenance-mode)
it.

:::tip demo

For a more detailed example of how to use this feature, you can refer to the
[Maintenance Mode Demo Extension](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/master/skeleton/example-extensions/maintenance-mode-demo).
This extension defines a health check that checks a hypothetical "acme" service,
and allows to mutate the status in a custom `/maintenance` route.

## The Health Check API

<Steps>
<Step>

### Adding a Health Check service

To add a health check, you need to define a function that checks the health of
your service and returns:

- `true`: when the service is `up`
- `false`: when the service is `down`
- `thrown Error`: assumes the service is `down`

This function is then passed to `addHealthCheckService` in the `onServerInit`
hook in your extension definition.

Here is an example:

```ts title="extensions/health-check.ts"
import { defineExtension } from "@front-commerce/core";

export default defineExtension({
  name: "health-check",
  meta: import.meta,
  unstable_lifecycleHooks: {
    onServerInit: async (services, request, config) => {
      // highlight-start
      services.MaintenanceMode.addHealthCheckService("acme", async () => {
        const response = await fetch("https://acme.com/api/health-check");
        return response.status === 200;
      });
      // highlight-end
    },
  },
});
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Configuring the global Cron interval

The health checks are run at a fixed interval determined by a
[Cron pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

By default, the interval is `*/10 * * * * *`, which means "every 10 seconds".

To configure a different interval, you can provide a pattern in your
`front-commerce.config.ts` file. For example, if you want to check the health of
your services every 30 seconds, you can do it like this:

```ts title="front-commerce.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core";

export default defineConfig({
  maintenance: {
    healthChecks: {
      schedule: "*/30 * * * * *",
    },
  },
});
```

:::important

The Cron interval applies to all the services being monitored. Each service
defined in `services.MaintenanceMode.addHealthCheckService` will use the same
interval.

### Manually disable all Health Checks

If you're experiencing issues with your health checks, for instance, if a change
in the health check URLs requires a manual intervention, you might want to
manually disable health checks to avoid your application automatically switching
to maintenance mode. This can be done by calling the
`/api/maintenance-mode/health` endpoint via a curl request using the same
[`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN`](./entering-and-exiting-maintenance-mode)
which you have configured to enable the maintenance mode feature:

```shell
curl --location \
      --request DELETE http://localhost:4000/api/maintenance-mode/health \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data-raw '{
          "token": "a-secret-token"
      }'
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Manual enable all Health Checks

Once you have resolved any issues and you want to restart the health checks, you
can run the following curl request to enable all health checks, using the same
[`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN`](./entering-and-exiting-maintenance-mode)
which you have configured to enable the maintenance mode feature:

```shell
curl --location \
      --request POST http://localhost:4000/api/maintenance-mode/health \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data-raw '{
          "token": "a-secret-token"
      }'
```
