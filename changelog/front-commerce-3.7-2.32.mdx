## Gezy foundations and bug fixes

Today we are releasing Front-Commerce 3.7 and 2.32. These releases are smaller
than usual, as our team has been enjoying a well-deserved summer break since our
latest releases 6 weeks ago!

The main highlight of the 3.7 release is the start of the integration with
**Gezy, which is the next e-commerce platform Front-Commerce will support.**

We also worked on fixing bugs and slightly improving existing features on all
our supported versions, based on the feedback we received from customers and
partners through our support channels.

## Gezy Integration Started

During the last weeks, we started working on a new integration with Gezy, the
e-commerce platform built at Lundi Matin. We have been working on the
foundational components of this integration, and will continue to increase
feature coverage in the upcoming releases.

For experienced Front-Commerce developers, this will allow you to build custom
storefronts with all the tools you already know and love, while leveraging the
features of Gezy's backend:

We will provide more information about this integration in the upcoming
releases. In the meantime, feel free toÂ <ContactLink>reach out to
us</ContactLink> if you want to learn about Gezy or have any questions related
to possible projects.

## A patch version awaits you!

It's always a good idea to keep your Front-Commerce project up to date and
benefit from these improvements.

We encourage you to read the details of the changes below, and upgrade your
projects to the latest patch version for your current minor version. Even
better, consider upgrading to the latest minor version to benefit from all the
improvements we have made since your latest upgrade!

:::info

We improved our **Release Schedule** documentation pages, to help you get a
better view of the upcoming releases and the current support status of each
version. You can find them in the
[**3.x release schedule**](/docs/3.x/upgrade/release-notes#release-schedule) and
[**2.x release schedule**](/docs/2.x/appendices/release-notes#release-schedule)
pages.

:::

We improved existing features and fixed bugs in these releases. Bugfixes were
ported to all supported versions when applicable.

- **Magento1**:

  - guests can now follow their orders progress in projects using Magento1
  - developers can now reuse Magento1 custom cart data in custom resolvers

- **Magento2 payments**:

  - we fixed an issue causing the `newCart.coupon` field to _randomly_ fail with
    `Request failed with status code 404` errors for payments using the async
    workflow. See
    [front-commerce/front-commerce!3610](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/3610)
    for details.

- **Adyen**:

  - we fixed an issue causing Adyen payment to fail when using pre-registered
    cards in 3.x.

- **Accessibility**

  - the `SelectMenu` component is now visible when used in a modal
  - we improved the accessibility of the `PriceFilter` and `OptionPicker`
    components
  - we adjusted the styles of the `ProductReviewsSynthesis` and `ProductItem` to
    improve the spacing of links
  - we pinned `react-paginate` to version 8.1.3 to avoid impacting Lighthouse
    scores. See
    [the related issue in the project](https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate/issues/459#issuecomment-1559808606).

- **Remix**:

  - we removed the `remix-redis-session` dependency and inlined its code in
    Front-Commerce so we can better control the session management.
  - redis session keys now have an expiry date, to prevent ever-growing session
    storage.
  - we re-introduced an environment variable
    `FRONT_COMMERCE_COOKIE_MAX_AGE_IN_SECONDS` to configure the redis session
    duration. In 2.x it was named `FRONT_COMMERCE_COOKIE_MAX_AGE_IN_MS`.
  - we pinned the 3.x `rollup` dependency version, to avoid an issue with the
    latest version (4.19.1) which would cause the skeleton not to build
    properly. The error was
    `[vite-plugin-pwa:build] Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getLiteralValueAtPath')`.

- **Akamai Image Manager**:

  - it is now possible to install the Akamai Image Manager extension in 3.x,
    without the error
    `Cannot find package '/path/to/project/node_modules/@front-commerce/akamai-image-manager/package.json' imported from /path/to/project/front-commerce.config.ts`

- **Quick order**:

  - it is now possible to submit partial quick order items
  - when an error occurs while adding a product to the cart, the error message
    is now displayed next to the related product

- **DX**:
  - in 3.x's development mode, projects using the `contentful` package no longer
    crash due to Vite optimisations (the error was
    `[vite] Error when evaluating SSR module virtual:front-commerce/config: failed to import "contentful"`)
  - we fixed an issue causing axios debug calls to not be properly logged in 3.x
- **Codemods:**
  - we fixed a critical regression from 3.6.0 causing codemods to crash in
    projects not importing the `payzen` package
  - 2.x imports of `web/core/analytics` are now correctly updated by codemods
