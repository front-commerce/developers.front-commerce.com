## Code changes

### Order filters

**Breaking:** In this release, we updated the order filters feature (released in
3.1.0) to support having filters fields linked by a "OR" logic. This changes
required a change in our GraphQL API which will break your application if you're
using this feature.

To cope with these changes, you will have to update the usage of `orderList`
query in your application, specifically the format of the `attributes` argument.
You should check for all components and / or routes you're using `orderList`
query from, and fix the usage of `attributes` argument:

```graphql
input OrderAttributesInput {
  "The attribute's name"
  name: String!
  "A list of value for the attribute"
  value: [String!]!
  "The type of filtering to use for this attribute"
  type: OrderAttributeInputType = CONTAINS
}
```

Became:

```graphql
input OrderAttributesInput {
  "The fields filtered"
  fields: [String!]!
  "A list of value for the attribute"
  values: [String!]!
  "The type of filtering to use for this attribute"
  type: OrderAttributeInputType = CONTAINS
}
```

`fields` is now an array of fields the filter should be applied to.

#### Example

Given this `attributes` object:

```json
[
  {
    "fields": ["id", "name"],
    "value": ["Foo", "123"]
  },
  {
    "fields": ["comment"],
    "value": ["Bar", "456"]
  }
]
```

The orders will be filtered with this logic:

```
(order.id contains "Foo"
  OR order.id contains "123"
  OR order.name contains "Foo"
  OR order.name contains "123")

AND

(order.comment contains "Bar"
  OR order.comment contains "456")
```
